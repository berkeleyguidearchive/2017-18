<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Instruction in the Department of Near Eastern Studies (NES) is concerned with the languages, literatures, and civilizations of the ancient, medieval, and modern Near East. The department offers specialized training in archaeology; Assyriology; Egyptology; Judaic and Islamic studies; Comparative Semitics; Turkish language; and Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian language and literature.</p>
<p>The department's courses also may serve to enhance programs in related fields such as anthropology, linguistics, history of art, history, political science, comparative literature, and folklore. Lecture courses offered by the department present a comprehensive body of information on past (Near Eastern) and present (Middle Eastern) civilizations. Many of the courses taught in the department are restricted to a small number of students and thus afford an opportunity for close interaction with the instructing staff.</p>
<p>Cooperative arrangements between the University and the nearby Graduate Theological Union (GTU) enable students in the department to use the extensive library holdings of the GTU and to supplement their programs with additional courses in Syro-Palestinian archaeology, Biblical studies, and Semitic epigraphy and philology.</p>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>The four NES libraries play an essential role in the Department of Near Eastern Studies and are indispensable for student research. The libraries house reference materials and function as reading and seminar rooms for students and faculty.</p>
<p>The Islamic Studies Library contains reference and other materials relating to Islamic Studies and Arabic, Persian, and Turkish languages and literatures, and incorporates the Mahjoub Persian Library. The Hebrew/Semitics library includes reference and other materials relating to the fields of Comparative Semitics, and Hebrew and Judaic studies. Access (apart from seminar classes) is generally limited to graduate students in the department. Both libraries are noncirculating. The Cuneiform Seminar Room is a library that provides a wide range of reference works, text editions, and primary sources for the study of the Ancient Near East, including Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, Archaeology, and Art History.</p>
<p>The Baer-Keller Library of Egyptology is a noncirculating collection of Egyptological volumes maintained by the Near Eastern Studies Department primarily for the use of UC Berkeley students and faculty pursuing serious study of Egyptology. Egyptology students and professionals from other institutions are also welcome; interested individuals should apply to the Near Eastern Studies Department for access. The core of the library collection comes from bequests to NES by Professors Klaus Baer (1987) and Cathleen (Candy) Keller (2008). Professor Baer was an Associate Professor of Egyptology and History at UC Berkeley before becoming a Professor of Egyptology at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago. Professor Keller was an Associate Professor of Egyptology at UC Berkeley for many years.</p>
<h3 class="introtext">Research</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/">Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology</a> has extensive holdings of ancient artifacts, including Classical material, cuneiform tablets and an ancient Egyptian collection of more than 17,000 objects.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://tebtunis.berkeley.edu/index">Tebtunis Papyri</a> consist of the papyrus documents that were found in the winter of 1899/1900 at the site of ancient Tebtunis, Egypt. The expedition to Tebtunis, led by the British archaeologists Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt, was financed for the University of California by Mrs. Phoebe Apperson Hearst. The Tebtunis Papyri are the largest collection of papyrus documents from a single site in the United States. Although the collection has never been counted and inventoried completely, the number of fragments contained in it exceeds 21,000.</p>
<p>The department's Ancient Near Eastern Seminar Room houses two Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/">(ORACC)</a> projects: the Digital Corpus of Cuneiform Lexical Texts <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/dcclt/">(DCCLT) </a>under the directorship of <a href="http://nes.berkeley.edu/Web_Veldhuis/index.html"> Niek Veldhuis</a> and Hellenistic Babylonian Texts Images and Names <a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/hbtin">(HBTIN)</a> directed by Laurie Pearce.  Dr. Pearce also heads another digital database project, the Berkeley Prosopography Service<a href="http://berkeleyprosopography.org/"> (BPS)</a>.</p>

The course focuses on ancient astronomy from Babylonia to the Greco-Roman world. Readings from primary texts, including Babylonian astronomical and astrological documents (MUL.APIN, Enuma Anu Enlil, etc.) and Greek treatises such as Geminos= Introduction to the Phenomena and Ptolemy's Almagest are used. Problems of the calendar and of planetary motion are of special interest. Two different approaches to celestial phenomena are covered, one from</span><span class="deschide"> cuneiform texts, predominantly arithmetical and linear and the other from hellenistic Greek antiquity, characteristically geometrical and introducing a quantitative dimension only after contact with and borrowing from Babylonian astronomy.</span><br/>

This course examines the social and religious lives of women and men through the lens of the law. A major concern is the relationship between law and culture, namely, the ways in which the law reflected ideals and tensions ranging from ideological competition between states to the problems of ordinary townspeople and peasants. In analyzing actual court cases, we will ask how individuals participated in the life of the court, and how they used the court to articulate</span><span class="deschide"> their own self-interest and sense of moral worth. Readings will be in English. Students wishing to work with sources in the original Ottoman Turkish should also enroll in Turkish 104 (1 unit).</span><br/>
