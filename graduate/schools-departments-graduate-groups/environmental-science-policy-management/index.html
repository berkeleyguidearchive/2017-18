<h2>Overview</h2>




<p class="Default">The Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM) Graduate Program provides a wealth of opportunities for students interested in careers in academia, government, and non-governmental agencies worldwide. Our <a href="http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/faculty-specialists/"><span class="Hyperlink1">faculty</span></a> are internationally recognized, and ESPM is the campus hub for connections to other renowned Berkeley programs in the environment such as the <a href="http://erg.berkeley.edu/"><span class="Hyperlink1">Energy and Resources Group</span></a>, <a href="http://areweb.berkeley.edu/"><span class="Hyperlink1">Agricultural and Resource Economics</span></a>, the <span class="Hyperlink1">Goldman School of Public Policy</span>, <a href="https://ib.berkeley.edu"><span class="Hyperlink0">Integrative Biology</span></a>, <a href="http://bnhm.berkeley.edu/"><span class="Hyperlink1">Berkeley Natural History Museums</span></a><span class="Hyperlink1">,</span> and <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu"><span class="Hyperlink0">Berkeley Law</span></a>. The Berkeley campus maintains close ties to world-class research facilities at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, U.S. Geological Survey, California Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and many other institutions. Students admitted to our program work with their research mentor to select courses, individualize their training, and conduct research projects that meet their interests and goals. Our core graduate courses provide an introduction to the wide breadth and deep expertise of research on the environment within our department and help students apply for funding opportunities early in their graduate program.</p>




<p class="Default">The<a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/degrees/the-phd-program"> </a><a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/degrees/the-phd-program"><span class="Hyperlink1">PhD program</span></a> is the main graduate program in ESPM for students entering with or without previous masters degrees, though we also offer limited numbers of MS degrees in our specialized <a href="http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/degrees/ms-range-management/"><span class="Hyperlink1">Master of Range Management</span></a> and <a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/graduate-programs/degrees/master-of-forestry"><span class="Hyperlink1">Master of Forestry</span> </a>programs. The goal of the program is to provide both a strong disciplinary education and broadly based experience in cross-disciplinary communication and problem solving. To achieve this, the program leading to the PhD in environmental science, policy, and management requires that students complete three core courses and take additional coursework in the following three areas: area of specialization, research skills, and experiential breadth.</p>




<div>
<hr/></div>




<a name="disciplinaryemphasis"></a>
<h3>Disciplinary Emphasis</h3>




<p>The disciplinary emphasis is the broadest academic area encompassing the student's interests. The three disciplinary emphases within the department are Ecosystem Sciences, Organisms &amp; Environment, and Society &amp; Environment. A student pursuing a strongly interdisciplinary program may study more than one of these disciplines in depth. Specific coursework within each field will be chosen by the guiding committee in conjunction with the student and approved by the graduate mentor. </p>




<a name="areaofspecialization"></a>
<h3>Area of Specialization</h3>




<p>The area of specialization is a narrower field within the context of the disciplinary emphasis. Some examples of these areas are microbial community ecology, ecosystem function, arthropod population and community ecology, biological control of arthropods, arthropod biodiversity science, American environmental history and policy, international forest management, biogeochemistry, Mediterranean grassland ecosystems, remote sensing, and forest management, to name a few.</p>




<a name="application"></a>
<h3>Application</h3>




<p>Prospective graduate students are encouraged to contact directly a potential PhD mentor prior to the application deadline and if possible, to visit the campus, department, and graduate program. As part of their application, each student will be asked to identify one of the three disciplinary emphases (ecosystem sciences, organisms &amp; environment, and society &amp; environment) most closely associated with her/his interests. If you have questions about which emphasis to choose, please ask your prospective mentor. It is not uncommon for students in ESPM to be co-mentored by two professors, often with different disciplinary emphases. The area of specialization is determined after entry into the program, in consultation with the guiding committee and PhD mentor.</p>

The course presents a diachronic perspective on human-fire interactions with local ecosystems in California that spans over 10,000 years. The course will provide an historical perspective on human-fire interactions at the landscape scale using a diverse range of data sources drawn from the fields of fire ecology, biology, history, anthropology, and archaeology. An important component includes examining how diverse cultures and ethnicity influenced how people perceived</span><span class="deschide"> and used fire at the landscape scale in ancient, historical and modern times. The implications of these diverse fire practices and policies will be analyzed and the consequences they have had for transforming habitats and propagating catastrophic fires will be explored.</span><br/>

From interactive web maps to spatial data analysis, digital geographic data and information are becoming an important part of the data science landscape. Almost everything happens somewhere that can be mapped on the surface of the earth. In many cases the where matters as much to an analysis as the what and the why.

Insects display an incredibly rich array of behaviors, including extravagant displays, rituals, deception, sociality, and slavery. In some cases, these behaviors are innate, but in other cases individual insects can actively learn and modify their future behaviors based on real-life experiences. This course will focus on the development, structure, and function of insect behaviors, using examples from classic and recent publications. We will examine</span><span class="deschide"> the evolution of insect behavior, how these behaviors play a role in the ecology of the organisms that express them, and explore various modes of communication that allow insects to judge their environment and respond appropriately.</span><br/>
