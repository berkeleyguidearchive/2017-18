<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="column column-number-1 column-span-1">
<p>UC Berkeley’s Department of Art Practice provides professional art training within the context of a world-renowned public research university. The department offers innovative, interdisciplinary courses leading to BA and MFA degrees. As practicing visual artists, the faculty of the Department of Art Practice hold as a principal goal the representation and analysis of human experiences through creative research in visual art. In making art, faculty members seek to expand the boundaries of cultures and the limits of perceptions <span>through rigorous experimentation with art forms, media, and content. Considering human experiences from an experiential standpoint, experimentation leads to questioning beliefs, rituals, and philosophies as well as social, economic, and institutional structures. In teaching, the mission is to help students pose profound questions by developing their creative voices, mastering their practices, relating to their audiences, and connecting to histories of art and cultures.</span></p>
<p>Four goals underlie the teaching in the Department of Art:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To advance the body of knowledge of human experience through aesthetic investigation.</li>
	<li>To help students learn to think visually.</li>
	<li>To help students understand the strategies that artists have devised to deal with aesthetic problems in both traditional and nontraditional methods of art making.</li>
	<li>To help students develop a creative intelligence through practicing a visual arts discipline.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Facilities and Resources</h3>
<p>The Department of Art Practice facilities include six studio spaces: <a href="http://art.berkeley.edu/facilities-and-resources/printmaking-labs/" target="_blank">Printmaking Studio</a>, <a href="http://art.berkeley.edu/facilities-and-resources/drawingpainting-studios/" target="_blank">Painting and Drawing Studio</a>, <a href="http://art.berkeley.edu/facilities-and-resources/sculpture-labs-wood-metal/" target="_blank">Wood and Metal Sculpture Studio</a>, <a href="http://art.berkeley.edu/facilities-and-resources/digital-media-labs/" target="_blank">Digital Media Labs</a> (for photography, video, audio, and animation productions) in Kroeber Hall, the <a href="http://art.berkeley.edu/facilities-and-resources/ceramics-labs/" target="_blank">Ceramics Studio</a>, and Project Lab in Wurster Hall.</p>

The ‘designed world’ is implicated in everyday experience. In an increasingly technological and communications based culture-from print to the Web, advertisements to movies, the built environment to modes of pedagogy-we encounter the visual/sensory as a ‘designed world’ in every area of our lives. Art 8 A: Intro to Visual Thinking asks students to rigorously and critically interrogate the ‘designed world.’ To do this students will look at a range of art</span><span class="deschide">, media, and invention across many locations and periods of history.</span><br/>

This course will challenge students to use ceramics as a way to explore and understand three-dimensional space, and use a contemporary art framework for critiquing and discussing the work produced. We will develop a practical understanding of how clay and glaze behave, while building a conceptual framework through which to apply this knowledge. Studio practice includes hand building, modeling, carving, and glazing as possibilities for turning</span><span class="deschide"> ideas into three dimensional propositions. Illustrated talks will help acquaint students with the ideas artists have explored through history and in contemporary sculptural practices.</span><br/>

This is a basic foundation class for digital photography with hands-on instruction in the use of digital cameras and online image dissemination. Topics include image capture, composition, image syntax, image analysis, image manipulation, meta-text production, and image sequencing for visual narratives. We also study image dissemination through online networks-social networks, blogs, news, storage</span><span class="deschide">, search, and print services. Rather than limiting the discussion of photography to the production of the photographic image itself, we explore in written assignments how the reception of images can change based on context, usage, and network dynamics. We use required DSLR digital cameras to produce images for weekly photographic assignments.</span><br/>

This new course will enable students to think critically about, and engage in practical experiments in, the complex interactions between new media and perceptions and performances of embodiment, agency, citizenship, collective action, individual identity, time and spatiality. We will pay particular attention to the categories of personhood that make up the UC Berkeley American Cultures rubric (race and ethnicity), as well as to gender, nation,</span><span class="deschide"> and disability. The argument threading through the course will be the ways in which new media both reinforce pre-existing social hierarchies, and yet offer possibilities for the transcendence of those very categories. The new media -- and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester -- can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.</span><br/>

Can we measure everything? What is the role of privacy? Can we count beauty? Is data always fair? This course explores participation as the foundation of online citizenship. Participation is based on data literacy and community awareness. Through online assignments, peer reviews and video chats, students form communities of explorers and innovators who challenge data culture through creative interventions including surveys, visualization, animation</span><span class="deschide">, video, interaction design, music and other forms of digital expression. Assignments are based on readings about media theory, abstraction, interactivity, design theory, archives, performance, identity, privacy, automation, aggregation, networking, diffusion, diffraction and subversion.</span><br/>

Motion is a ubiquitous element of human experience, yet attempts to explain it remain incomplete. The representation of motion with technical means is in continuous development, starting perhaps with sculptural representations of celestial movements in antiquity and leading to dynamic computer graphics simulations of molecular processes today. In this production-intensive studio course, we will study</span><span class="deschide"> computer graphics for motion simulations, or animations. We will also probe these tools for their use in creative expression and analyze their impact on our own perception of motion. Software used: Maya. Each week will include relevant readings, class discussions, guest speakers, demonstration of examples, and studio time for training and working on student assignments .</span><br/>
