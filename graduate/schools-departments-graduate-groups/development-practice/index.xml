Graduate seminar examining the role of energy science, technology, and policy in<br/>
international development. The course will look at how changes in the theory and practice<br/>
of energy systems and of international development have co-evolved over the past half-<br/>
century, and what opportunities exist going forward.<br/>
<br/>
A focus will be on rural and decentralized energy use, and the issues of technology, culture,<br/>
and</span><span class="deschide"> politics that are raised by both current trajectories, and potential alternative energy<br/>
choices. We will explore the frequently divergent ideas about energy and development that<br/>
have emerged from civil society, academia, multinational development agencies, and the<br/>
private and industrial sector.</span><br/>
