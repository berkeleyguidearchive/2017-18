<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><span>Computational biology is an academic growth area that binds together multiple areas of biological research with the mathematical and computational sciences. It takes center stage in the new data-oriented biology by facilitating scientific discoveries based on high-throughput methods. The genomic revolution has fundamentally changed the biological sciences, and computational biology provides the means for translation of genomic discoveries into a new understanding of complex biological systems and eventually into improvements of the human condition through the development of solutions to environmental problems, new drug discoveries, and personalized medicine.</span></p>
<p>The Center for Computational Biology is Berkeley’s hub for research and training in computational biology and bioinformatics. Through courses, seminars, scientific meetings, and innovative training programs for PhD students administered by the Graduate Group in Computational Biology, the center catalyzes biological discoveries at the interface of biology, computation, and mathematics/statistics. As a campus strategic initiative, the center fosters an interactive, innovative, and collegiate environment for faculty, students, and postdoctorates drawn from five colleges and over a dozen academic departments. Faculty research interests are likewise diverse, ranging from computational and statistical genomics to population, comparative, and functional genomics; from bioinformatics and proteomics to evolutionary biology, phylogenomics, and statistical and computational methods development for modeling biological systems.</p>

Computational biology is an interdisciplinary field that develops and/or applies computational methods including bioinformatics to analyze large collections of biological data such as genomic data with a goal of making new predictions or discoveries. Precision medicine is an emerging approach for human disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person. Computational biology and bioinformatics</span><span class="deschide"> tools are critical for advancing precision medicine. This survey course introduces computational tools for the analysis of genomic data and approaches to understanding and advancing precision medicine.</span><br/>

The goals of this course are to introduce students to Python, a simple and powerful programming language that is used for many applications, and to expose them to the practical bioinformatic utility of Python and programming in general. The course will allow students to apply programming to the problems that they face in the lab and to leave this course with a sufficiently generalized knowledge of programming (and the confidence to read the manuals) that they will</span><span class="deschide"> be able to apply their skills to whatever projects they happen to be working on.</span><br/>
