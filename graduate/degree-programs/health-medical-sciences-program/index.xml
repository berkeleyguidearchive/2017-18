<p class="Normal1">The UC Berkeley-UCSF Joint Medical Program (JMP) is a five-year graduate/medical degree program. The pre-clerkship years are spent at UC Berkeley, engaging in a leading-edge integrated Problem-Based Learning medical curriculum while simultaneously earning a master's degree (MS) in the Health and Medical Sciences at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health. For their MS degrees, students can pursue research in any field of knowledge with a link to human health.  After 2.5 years, our students move across the bay to UCSF to finish their medical education and receive their MDs.</p>

<h3 class="Normal1">Capstone/Thesis (Plan I)</h3>
<p class="Normal1">A JMP student’s MS coursework and research culminates in the crafting of a thesis, including an in-depth literature review of the student’s area of expertise and a scholarly product, often a manuscript for submission to a journal. Students can pursue research in any field of knowledge with a link to human health.  A database of prior JMP research theses can be accessed at: <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/ucb_ucsf_joint_medical_program" target="_blank">http://escholarship.org/uc/ucb_ucsf_joint_medical_program</a></p>
