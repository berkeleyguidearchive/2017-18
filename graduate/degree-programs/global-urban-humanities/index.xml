<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4b3bb4b0-c1f9-d02b-d5e7-d136c83f10a9">The </span>Global Urban Humanities Graduate Certificate <span> provides an academic structure for the study of contemporary and historical cities using methods from the environmental design disciplines, the arts and humanities, and the interpretive social sciences. Global Urban Humanities is an emerging interdisciplinary field in which hybrid methods of investigation including artistic and interpretive as well as analytical approaches are applied to the study of urban form and experience.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4b3bb4b0-c1f9-d02b-d5e7-d136c83f10a9">Through a three-course series, the Certificate offers PhD and master's degree students the opportunity to supplement their major areas of study with courses that explore cities through a variety of disciplinary approaches. In particular, the Certificate emphasizes the intersection of interpretive approaches from the arts and humanities (including close reading, formal analysis, discourse analysis and the making of artistic work products) with methods from the environmental design disciplines (including spatial analysis, representation, and iterative design interventions as a means of research).</span></p>
<p>The Certificate Program is led by Faculty Directors Jennifer Wolch, Dean of the College of Environmental Design and Anthony J. Cascardi, Dean of Arts &amp; Humanities</p>

<p>There are three required courses for the Global Urban Humanities Graduate Certificate: </p>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>a Core Seminar </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>a Core Interdisciplinary Research Studio</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>an Elective</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-1c3ae173-c217-28f3-835f-e77de21f3e23">Core Seminar</span></strong></h4>
<p>The Core Seminar will introduce you to theories and methods for investigating urban form and the human experience in cities through readings, discussion, written assignments, and exercises that may include ethnographic interviewing, mapping, and visual representation. You will be helping shape the emerging field of urban humanities through readings that may include authors including Michel de Certeau, Partha Chatterjee, Guy Debord, David Harvey, Henri Lefebvre, Kevin Lynch, Richard Sennett, Abdoumaliq Simone, and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. The course will be offered as Populism, Art and the City in Spring 2018 and will be taught by Angela Marino (Performance Studies) and Jason Luger (City and Regional Planning).</p>

<h4><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-1c3ae173-c217-28f3-835f-e77de21f3e23">Core </span>Interdisciplinary Research Studio</strong></h4>
<p>The Core Interdisciplinary Research Studio will give you an opportunity to conduct a fieldwork-based investigation of a city. In 2018 through 2020, this will be a city overseas. The course is inspired by the tradition of studio pedagogy in architecture and urban planning and results in work products that often take the form of visual products as well as written essays. This research studio is designed to provide a unique experience that allows students without a background in design to fully participate in the studio experience along with students who do have that background. No previous design experience or ability to produce visual products is required. The course will be offered in Spring 2018 as Borderwall Urbanism, <span class="sc_courseinline">ARCH 209</span>, taught by Ronald Rael (Architecture) and Stephanie Syjuco (Art Practice).</p>
<h4><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-1c3ae173-c217-28f3-835f-e77de21f3e23">Elective Courses</span></strong></h4>
<p>The elective course is an opportunity for further exploration of topics or methods in the study of cities. For the elective requirement, you are required to take a course outside your home discipline and division. (Exceptions will be considered by petition. For the purposes of this requirement, History will be counted as a Humanities discipline even though it is in the Social Sciences Division.) You may petition to count courses not on this list using the program’s <a href="http://globalurbanhumanities.berkeley.edu/uploads/Graduate_Certificate_Elective_Petition_Final.docx">Elective Petition form</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: Because the content of courses listed here may change from year to year, the courses listed below and other electives must be confirmed with GUH staff. Be sure that courses and sections are confirmed as GUH electives for the semester in question.

<h4>Intellectual Community</h4>
<p>The Global Urban Humanities Graduate Certificate provides a unique opportunity for making connections with students from across the campus with a shared interest in global cities, including urban areas in the United States. Participation in the Certificate program makes you part of an active community of scholars and urban practitioners and artists engaged in developing new methods of research and teaching.</p>
<h4>Global Perspective</h4>
<p>The Certificate is based on the notion that learning occurs in many directions and that cities in the Global South are important sources of knowledge and not just objects of study. The same is true of diverse neighborhoods within global cities in North America.</p>
<h4>Interdisciplinary Approach</h4>
<p>The certificate offers a framework for incorporating theories and methods for interrogating urban places from disciplines both within and outside students’ home departments. For students planning to enter the design and planning professions, the Certificate will provide an opportunity to incorporate critical approaches from the humanities in their work. For students in the humanities and social sciences, the Certificate will facilitate their participation in coursework that addresses both urban form and urban experience, and provide a chance to experience the research studio method, a pedagogy central to environmental design education.</p>
<h4>Enhancement of Employability</h4>
<p>For PhD students, the Certificate will demonstrate not only your knowledge of cities but your exposure to methods of experiential, project-based learning that may be valued by academic employers. GSI opportunities may give you a chance to build your pedagogy portfolio. For students in professional programs, the Certificate shows your interest in the human dimension of cities and your ability to interpret urban culture and experience through ethnography, storytelling, mapping, visual representation and other methods.</p>
