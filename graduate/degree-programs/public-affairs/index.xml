<p>Entering the degree mid-career, Master of Public Affairs students are accomplished managers and executives in their fields with diverse and extensive work experience. In some cases, students already hold an advanced degree or advanced training in a field. The focus of the degree is on policy analysis combined with deep engagement on questions of organizational leadership, innovation, strategy, and adaptation. The MPA curriculum has been strategically designed to not only equip students with the fundamentals to succeed in policy-driven roles, but also to give them the leadership capabilities necessary to excel. </p>

We will discuss where new ideas come from and how they can be generated, evaluated and implemented. The methods developed in other parts of the summer curriculum become the support for proving that new ideas are good ideas (or for finding out that they are bad ideas). We will explore how</span><span class="deschide"> each method can be useful to a leader (both formal and informal) at various levels within a public organization through case studies and real world examples. The course will introduce leadership themes which will be explored further in PUB AFF 283: Leading People and Organizations.</span><br/>
