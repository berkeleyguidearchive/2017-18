<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Psychology as a scientific discipline aims to describe, understand, and predict the behavior of living organisms. In doing so, psychology embraces the many factors that influence behavior - from sensory experience to complex cognition, from the role of genetics to that of social and cultural environments, from the processes that explain behavior in early childhood to those that operate in older ages, and from normal development to pathological conditions. The Psychology Department at UC Berkeley reflects the diversity of our discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, our program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>The Department of Psychology’s <a href="http://psychology.berkeley.edu/post-bac">Postbaccalaureate Certificate Program</a> is a comprehensive retraining and immersion program for students interested in applying to graduate school in psychology. The program features intensive coursework to complete an undergraduate psychology major in three or four semesters, research opportunities with our world-class faculty, in-depth advising, and a supportive community. If you are inspired to enter the field of psychology, switching focus from a previous major or changing careers, the postbaccalaureate program may be a path to consider.  </p>
<h3>Clinic</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://psychology.berkeley.edu/clinics/mission">Psychology Clinic</a> is a center for clinical training and research. The Psychology Clinic is part of the Clinical Science Program in the Department of Psychology at UC Berkeley. This graduate program is committed to excellence in scientific training, and to using clinical science as the foundation for designing, implementing, and evaluating assessment and intervention procedures. Established in 1963, The Psychology Clinic provides mental health services to Berkeley and surrounding Bay Area communities. We conduct research in a variety of areas, such as intervention programs for children with ADHD, adolescents with depression and sleep difficulties, people with bipolar disorder, people with anxiety, qualities of marital interaction,  and the emotional and social difficulties associated with mental illness. We also provide comprehensive assessment services for a variety of people, including children with ADHD and adults with mild cognitive impairment. Our staff includes doctoral students and interns in the Clinical Science Program and supervising faculty and clinicians from the community.</p>

These traits can become incorporated into offline personality, turning us into our avatar. Other psychological damage comes from the lack of online privacy and our new relationship with information.

The human brain is a complex information processing system and is currently the topic of multiple fascinating branches of research. Understanding how it works is a very challenging scientific task. In recent decades, multiple techniques for imaging the activity of the brain at work have been invented, which has allowed the field of cognitive neuroscience to flourish. Cognitive neuroscience is concerned with studying the neural mechanisms underlying various aspects</span><span class="deschide"> of cognition, by relating the activity in the brain to the tasks being performed by it. This typically requires exciting collaborations with other disciplines (e.g. psychology, biology, physics, computer science).</span><br/>

Topics may include associative learning, habit formation</span><span class="deschide">, fear, memory systems, neurons, synapses, dendritic spines and axonal boutons, LTP, and adult neurogenesis.

The course uses a comparative approach to examine the reciprocal interactions between the neuroendocrine system and behavior, considering the effects of hormone on development and adult behavior in addition</span><span class="deschide"> to how behavior regulates endocrine physiology. While much of the course focuses on non-human vertebrate species, the relevance to humans is explored where appropriate.

What are the changes in brain structure and function that underlie improvements in cognitive abilities over childhood and adolescence? Or, coming from a different perspective, what insights can we gain regarding the neural basis of cognition by examining how the brain develops? And how are such findings relevant for medicine, education, and the law?

We will discuss how this understanding may be different, depending on whether one has studied psychology, neuroscience, education, social welfare, public health, or public policy, and how each contributes to our deeper understanding of children’s healthy development.</span><br/>

This course will teach a human-centered, evidence-based method for finding new ways to solve persistent problems: Design Thinking. Design Thinking is a methodology for collaborative problem solving pioneered at the design firm IDEO and Stanford University to come up with game-changing solutions to difficult problems. As student learners accustomed to taking others’ perspectives and problem solving, we are especially well-suited to use Design</span><span class="deschide"> Thinking.<br/>

This is a hands-on course teaching the principles of functional MRI (fMRI) data analysis. We will teach you how to work with data and code to get a deeper understanding of how fMRI methods work, how they can fail, how to fix them, and how to develop new methods. We will cover the basic concepts in neuroimaging analysis, and how they relate to the wider world of statistics, engineering and computer science. At the same time we will teach you techniques</span><span class="deschide"> of data analysis that will make your work easier to organize, understand, explain and share. At the end of the course we expect you to be able to analyze fMRI data using Python and keep track of your work with version control using git.</span><br/>
