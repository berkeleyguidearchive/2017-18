<h2>Overview</h2>




<p>Psychology as a scientific discipline aims to describe, understand, and predict the behavior of living organisms. In doing so, psychology embraces the many factors that influence behavior - from sensory experience to complex cognition, from the role of genetics to that of social and cultural environments, from the processes that explain behavior in early childhood to those that operate in older ages, and from normal development to pathological conditions. The Psychology Department at UC Berkeley reflects the diversity of our discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, our program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>




<p>The Department of Psychology’s <a href="http://psychology.berkeley.edu/post-bac">Postbaccalaureate Certificate Program</a> is a comprehensive retraining and immersion program for students interested in applying to graduate school in psychology. The program features intensive coursework to complete an undergraduate psychology major in three or four semesters, research opportunities with our world-class faculty, in-depth advising, and a supportive community. If you are inspired to enter the field of psychology, switching focus from a previous major or changing careers, the postbaccalaureate program may be a path to consider.  </p>

<h3>Clinic</h3>




<p>The <a href="http://psychology.berkeley.edu/clinics/mission">Psychology Clinic</a> is a center for clinical training and research. The Psychology Clinic is part of the Clinical Science Program in the Department of Psychology at UC Berkeley. This graduate program is committed to excellence in scientific training, and to using clinical science as the foundation for designing, implementing, and evaluating assessment and intervention procedures. Established in 1963, The Psychology Clinic provides mental health services to Berkeley and surrounding Bay Area communities. We conduct research in a variety of areas, such as intervention programs for children with ADHD, adolescents with depression and sleep difficulties, people with bipolar disorder, people with anxiety, qualities of marital interaction,  and the emotional and social difficulties associated with mental illness. We also provide comprehensive assessment services for a variety of people, including children with ADHD and adults with mild cognitive impairment. Our staff includes doctoral students and interns in the Clinical Science Program and supervising faculty and clinicians from the community.</p>

Most people have an online alter ego that is stronger and sexier but also angrier, more impulsive, and less ethical. These traits can become incorporated into offline personality, turning us into our avatar. Other psychological damage comes from the lack of online privacy and our new relationship with information. But the “Net” effect is not all bad; technology can also contribute to psychological</span><span class="deschide"> wellbeing and make possible new treatments, including computerized therapy and virtual reality exposure therapy.</span><br/>

This course will explore mental processes that allow listeners to perceive music and performers to produce it. We will compare music from various traditions to examine shared cognitive principles and emotional responses; comparisons to language will highlight neural specializations for music. Developmental psychology will inform discussion of learned vs. innate components of musical behavior.

In this course, we will examine behavior change – in you, and in those others you wish you could change -- by looking at basic principles that apply across species: operant conditioning, classical conditioning, motivation, stress and development. Animal trainers rely on very specific principles when modifying behavior, and those principles apply to every animal, human and non-human animals alike.

The human brain is a complex information processing system and is currently the topic of multiple fascinating branches of research. Understanding how it works is a very challenging scientific task. In recent decades, multiple techniques for imaging the activity of the brain at work have been invented, which has allowed the field of cognitive neuroscience to flourish. Cognitive neuroscience is concerned with studying the neural mechanisms underlying various aspects</span><span class="deschide"> of cognition, by relating the activity in the brain to the tasks being performed by it. This typically requires exciting collaborations with other disciplines (e.g. psychology, biology, physics, computer science).</span><br/>

Topics may include associative learning, habit formation</span><span class="deschide">, fear, memory systems, neurons, synapses, dendritic spines and axonal boutons, LTP, and adult neurogenesis. We will discuss these topics in the context of normal development and disease.

In this course, we examine the developmental trajectories that lead to mental illness in young children by: 1) understanding abnormal development in the context of normal development, and vice versa; 2) using a developmental approach to identify continuities and discontinuities; 3) addressing how mental illness develops and why; 4) learning the role genes and contexts of development play; 5) investigating multiple levels</span><span class="deschide">, and the dynamic reciprocal transactions among them; and 6) applying our knowledge to children’s real-world experiences, to better understand the mental illness, its mechanisms, and its challenges.</span><br/>

This lecture and small group activity course will examine the development of young children—from the prenatal period to age 8—in the varied contexts in which development occurs. The course is designed to introduce the basic theories and the research approaches that have been used to develop them. We will also explore how the contexts, the influences of environments in which children are growing and living, affect their</span><span class="deschide"> development and our understanding of children. We will discuss how this understanding may be different, depending on whether one has studied psychology, neuroscience, education, social welfare, public health, or public policy, and how each contributes to our deeper understanding of children’s healthy development.</span><br/>

This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to an understanding of happiness. We will first review the different treatments of happiness in the world’s philosophical traditions: conceptions of the good life in classical Greek and Judeo-Christian thought, the great East Asian philosophies, and ideas about happiness that emerged in the age of Enlightenment. With these different perspectives as a framework, the</span><span class="deschide"> course will turn to treatments of happiness in the behavioral sciences, evolutionary scholarship, and neuroscience. Special Emphasis will be given to understanding how happiness arises in experiences of the moral emotions, including gratitude, compassion, reverence and awe, and aesthetic emotions like humor and beauty.</span><br/>

The course will review research on culture, race, and ethnicity and will consider the implications of these findings for our understanding of race, culture, and ethnicity in American society.

This is a hands-on course teaching the principles of functional MRI (fMRI) data analysis. We will teach you how to work with data and code to get a deeper understanding of how fMRI methods work, how they can fail, how to fix them, and how to develop new methods. We will cover the basic concepts in neuroimaging analysis, and how they relate to the wider world of statistics, engineering and computer science. At the same time we will teach you techniques</span><span class="deschide"> of data analysis that will make your work easier to organize, understand, explain and share. At the end of the course we expect you to be able to analyze fMRI data using Python and keep track of your work with version control using git.</span><br/>
