				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Psychology as a scientific discipline aims to describe, understand, and predict the behavior of living organisms. In doing so, psychology embraces the many factors that influence behavior — from sensory experience to complex cognition, from the role of genetics to that of social and cultural environments, from the processes that explain behavior in early childhood to those that operate in older ages, and from normal development to pathological conditions. The Psychology Department at UC Berkeley reflects the diversity of our discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>The major serves three purposes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>For the liberal arts student, the study of psychology provides an avenue for increased self-understanding and insight into the behavior of others. The objective study of behavior is one of the major themes of intellectual history in the last hundred-plus years.</li>
	<li>For students preparing for training in such professions as medicine, law, education and business, psychology provides important basic knowledge and principles.</li>
	<li>For students who plan on pursuing graduate work in psychology, the undergraduate major seeks to establish a sound foundation of research principles and knowledge of a variety of content areas.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Psychology is a capped (impacted) major at UC Berkeley. This means that due to high demand, the program unfortunately cannot accommodate every student who wishes to major in Psychology. As part of the terms of being a capped major, all students who apply to the major and meet the following criteria are guaranteed admission:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Have a 3.2 grade point average (GPA) in<em> the seven/eight</em> prerequisite courses. (Note: GPA is not rounded up.)</li>
	<li>Students who entered UC Berkeley as a freshman must declare the major by their 5th semester OR prior to the accumulation of 80 semester units including work in progress (AP or college credit obtained in high school do not count towards the 80 units). Those who entered Berkeley as a junior level transfer must declare the major no later than their first semester at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>Submit the application to the major by the posted deadline. Please refer to the department <a href="http://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-program/applying-major">website </a>for exact deadlines. </li>
</ol>
<p>If any of the above criteria are not met, students may still be admitted to the major. However, there is <em><strong>no guarantee</strong></em>. Please understand that applications will not be processed until all prerequisite courses are complete and final grades have been posted. This may mean that students will not technically be admitted to the major until the beginning of the following semester.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a 3.5 GPA in their major and 3.3 GPA overall may apply for admission to the honors program. For students interested in the honors program, it is recommended to participate in the <a href="http://research.berkeley.edu/urap/">Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program</a> (URAP) or departmental research during their junior year. This will prepare them for experimental research and design necessary for completing their own project.</p>
<p>Students are <strong><em>required </em></strong>to complete the following courses, none of which count toward major requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20102" title="PSYCH 102" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 102');">PSYCH 102</a></span> Statistics for Psychological Research is a 3 unit upper division course that is designed to introduce students to the data analysis techniques researchers using the field of psychology. This course is only offered in fall and may be taken as early as the junior year. This course <em>must </em>be taken for a letter grade (P/NP grading not accepted). Completion of <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%2010" title="PSYCH 10" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 10');">PSYCH 10</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20101" title="PSYCH 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 101');">PSYCH 101</a></span> is a required prerequisite to this course. </li>
	<li><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=UGIS%20192B" title="UGIS 192B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'UGIS 192B');">UGIS 192B</a></span>  or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20199" title="PSYCH 199" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 199');">PSYCH 199</a></span>  Students applying to the honors program are required to be a research apprentice in the laboratory of their intended faculty sponsor. Students must begin their research project in the spring of their junior year. The URAP office will provide the students enrollment information for UGIS 192 (course control number and class entry code) to register via Tele-BEARS and the Psychology Student Services Office will provide enrollment information for Psych 199. A minimum of 2 units of UGIS 192 or Psych 199 is required.</li>
	<li> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20H194A" title="PSYCH H194A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH H194A');">PSYCH H194A</a></span> / <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20H194B" title="PSYCH H194B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH H194B');">PSYCH H194B</a></span> Honors students are required to concurrently enroll in Psychology H194A-B (2 units per semester), the honors seminar, in their senior year. This course provides excellent supplemental background for preparing the thesis. </li>
	<li> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20H195A" title="PSYCH H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH H195A');">PSYCH H195A</a></span> / <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20H195B" title="PSYCH H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH H195B');">PSYCH H195B</a></span> Psychology H195A-B is offered for 1-3 units per semester and is mandatory in order to receive honors in the major. The course is sequential with a grade of In Progress or “IP” for the &quot;A&quot; portion and the final grade assigned for both semesters at the end of the &quot;B&quot; portion. </li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Psychology Department at Berkeley reflects the diversity of the discipline's mission covering six key areas of research: Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience; Clinical Science; Cognition; Cognitive Neuroscience; Developmental, and Social-Personality Psychology. Despite the existence of these specialization areas, the program learning goals focus on fostering methodological, statistical, and critical thinking skills that are not tied to any one particular content area in psychology but are relevant for all of them.</p>
<p>Most of the program level goals are introduced in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%201" title="PSYCH 1" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 1');">PSYCH 1</a> General Psychology</span> These goals are extended and reinforced in a majority of the core courses. These include <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20101" title="PSYCH 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 101');">PSYCH 101</a> Research and Data Analysis in Psychology</span>, required of all majors, and the upper division Tier II courses that survey the major fields of psychology. There are several options to fulfill core coursework in each area and the following is a sampling of courses that fulfill the Tier II requirements: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20110" title="PSYCH 110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 110');">PSYCH 110</a> Introduction to Biological Psychology</span>; <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20C120" title="PSYCH C120" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH C120');">PSYCH C120</a> Basic Issues in Cognition</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20130" title="PSYCH 130" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 130');">PSYCH 130</a> Clinical Psychology</span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20140" title="PSYCH 140" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 140');">PSYCH 140</a> Developmental Psychology</span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20150" title="PSYCH 150" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 150');">PSYCH 150</a> Psychology of Personality</span> <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PSYCH%20160" title="PSYCH 160" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PSYCH 160');">PSYCH 160</a> Social Psychology</span>. The program is designed to ensure that all students gain broad exposure to the field of psychology. In addition, students are encouraged to develop a deeper understanding of at least one major content area in psychology.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>1.    Understand basic concepts that characterize psychology as a field of scientific inquiry, and appreciate the various subfields that form the discipline as well as things that differentiate it from other related disciplines<br/>
2.    Develop an understanding of the central questions/issues in contemporary psychology as well as a historical perspective of psychological theories and key empirical data<br/>
3.    Develop a thorough understanding of one of the major content areas of psychology (i.e., Social/Personality, Developmental, Clinical, Cognitive, Biological)<br/>
4.    Develop skills to critically evaluate the presentation of scientific ideas and research in original scientific papers as well as in the popular media.<br/>
5.    Become familiar with research methods used in psychological research, and become proficient in basic concepts of statistical analyses and familiar with more advanced methods in data analyses and modeling<br/>
6.    Learn to develop, articulate, and communicate, both orally and in written form, a testable hypothesis, or an argument drawing from an existing body of literature.<br/>
7.    Apply a psychological principle to an everyday problem, or take an everyday problem and identify the relevant psychological mechanisms/issues</p>

The human brain is a complex information processing system and is currently the topic of multiple fascinating branches of research. Understanding how it works is a very challenging scientific task. In recent decades, multiple techniques for imaging the activity of the brain at work have been invented, which has allowed the field of cognitive neuroscience to flourish. Cognitive neuroscience is concerned with studying the neural mechanisms underlying various aspects</span><span class="deschide"> of cognition, by relating the activity in the brain to the tasks being performed by it. This typically requires exciting collaborations with other disciplines (e.g. psychology, biology, physics, computer science).</span><br/>

This course will teach a human-centered, evidence-based method for finding new ways to solve persistent problems: Design Thinking. Design Thinking is a methodology for collaborative problem solving pioneered at the design firm IDEO and Stanford University to come up with game-changing solutions to difficult problems. As student learners accustomed to taking others’ perspectives and problem solving, we are especially well-suited to use Design</span><span class="deschide"> Thinking.<br/>

We will be tackling the problem of children’s school readiness. The goal of this class is to find imaginative and practical solutions -- imaginative enough to be exciting and effective for children and families, and practical enough to be able to pilot these solutions during the class.<br/></span><br/>
