				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><p>Sustainable Design implies making decisions at various scales of the built environment (buildings, communities, land use patterns, urban support systems) in ways that support environmental quality, social equity, and economic vitality. The undergraduate minor in Sustainable Design is jointly offered by the Department of Architecture and the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning but also includes interdisciplinary courses across campus. The minor is open to all majors at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>There is no major program; students interested in pursuing this course of study at the major level should consider the <a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/degree-programs/architecture/">BA in Architecture program</a> or the <a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/degree-programs/landscape-architecture/">BA in Landscape Architecture</a> program.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>A letter grade of C- or higher in ENV DES 1, LD ARCH 1, or LD ARCH 12 (or a 3 or higher in AP Env Sci) is required to declare the minor. To declare, students must submit the <a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/">CED Request to Add Minor Form</a>, available on the CED website. When completing the final requirements for the minor, submit the <a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/">CED Minor Completion Form</a>.</p>
<h3>Other Minors Offered by the Department of Architecture</h3>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. When completing their final requirements for the minor, students must submit the <a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/">CED Minor Completion Form</a>, available on the CED website.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A letter grade of C- or higher in ENV DES 1, LD ARCH 1, or LD ARCH 12 (or a 3 or higher in AP Env Sci) is required to declare the minor. To declare, submit the <a href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/students/undergraduate-advising/forms-documents/">CED Request to Add Minor Form</a>, available on the CED website.</li>
	<li>Each course used to fulfill minor requirements must be completed with a letter grade of C- or above.</li>
	<li>Students must earn a 2.0 GPA in the upper division requirements for the minor.</li>
	<li>Any course used in fulfillment of minor requirements may also be used to fulfill major and upper division CED non-major requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill a breadth requirement may also be used to satisfy minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Students may apply the non-CED version of a CED cross-listed course towards the minor.</li>
	<li>Students may use up to two courses taken abroad to fulfill upper division minor requirements, with faculty approval of the individual courses.</li>
</ol>
