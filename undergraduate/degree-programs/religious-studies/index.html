<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Program in Religious Studies is not accepting new majors or minors at this time. </span></p>
<hr/>
<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Religious Studies undergraduate major at UC Berkeley asks its students to secure a broad background in the liberal arts and also to focus on a thematic concern or a particular religious tradition. It views religion from a global perspective and combines aspects of the humanities and the social sciences. The major is open to anyone interested in studying religion and related phenomena academically. It is not directed especially to those who have a religious background or those who are thinking of pursuing a religious vocation. Majors will be challenged to regard religious traditions as both means and objects of intellectual inquiry and to regard their claims both appreciatively and critically.</p>
<p>The core religious studies courses present methodological questions and approaches to the study of religion (such as philosophy of religion, sociology of religion, history, interpretation), examine thematic, often cross-cultural phenomena (such as ritual, prayer and mysticism, and comparative ethics), or present issues within a particular religious tradition. Other courses available for the major originate in other disciplines on campus: for instance, history, anthropology, sociology, and language and literature departments. The traditions that may be included as fields of emphasis or supplementary courses include the Jewish, Islamic, Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist traditions as well as the religious cultures of China, Japan, Africa, and the Americas.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>For information regarding how to declare the major, please see the undergraduate adviser, Laura Spautz, in 237 Evans Hall.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students may elect to attempt graduation with honors if they have done well in both general university work and the major courses at the beginning of their senior year. Requirements include upper division work in a language relevant to the student's academic program (with consent of adviser) and the submission of a bachelor's thesis as a culmination of one or two semesters of the sequence, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RELIGST%20H195A" title="RELIGST H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RELIGST H195A');">RELIGST H195A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=RELIGST%20H195B" title="RELIGST H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'RELIGST H195B');">RELIGST H195B</a></span>. The thesis must be approved by both the adviser and the student's thesis director.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>Students wishing to receive a minor in Religious Studies should visit the student academic adviser in 237 Evans Hall.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://religiousstudies.ugis.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Program Website</a></p>

<h3>Field of Emphasis</h3>
<p>The field may be any cross-cultural theme (such as the study of ritual, myth, or ethics) in which three courses are available, a cultural period (such as the religious interaction of medieval Europe or modern Asia), or the study of a single religious tradition (such as Christianity or Buddhism).</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
