				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Engineering Mathematics and Statistics major offered through the Engineering Science Program offers students an opportunity to study pure and applied mathematics as essential components of modern engineering. By combining courses in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, the physical sciences, and engineering, a student may individualize a program of study, of theory, or of applications of both. It provides a broad foundation for graduate studies in theoretical branches of engineering, as well as in mathematics, and can prepare students for a career in specific sectors of industry or business.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Prospective undergraduates to the College of Engineering will apply for admission to a specific program in the college. For further information, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/admissions.html">College of Engineering's website</a>.</p>
<p>Admission to Engineering Science degree programs via a Change of College application for current UC Berkeley students is competitive as there are few — if any — spaces available in this major for students admitted to other colleges at UC Berkeley. For further information regarding a Change of College to Engineering, please see the <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college">College's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in Engineering Mathematics and Statistics.</p>

The course is concerned with giving students the tools to prepare for the fields and jobs of the future.<br/>
<br/>
Across all university departments and majors, the numbers of students who do not work in the fields in which they’ve received their degrees is not only significant, but growing. For example, anywhere from 20-40% of STEM graduates do not work in the fields in which they received their degrees.<br/>
<br/>
This does not mean that students shouldn’t major</span><span class="deschide"> in STEM, but that one of the primary purposes of higher education is learning how to learn. Accordingly, this course presents a number of frameworks that are critical for thinking about that which has not yet been invented.<br/></span><br/>
