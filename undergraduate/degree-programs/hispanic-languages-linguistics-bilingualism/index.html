				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The sequence of undergraduate programs of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese is designed to lead from the acquisition of competence in written and spoken Spanish or Portuguese, through an acquaintance with the structure and history of one or both of these languages and a critical understanding of the development and achievements of their literatures in the Old World and in the New, to training in advanced study and independent research. The department’s policy is to maintain a balanced strength between language and literature and between Peninsular and Latin American facets of a unified field.</p>
<p><span class="acronym">This track is recommended for students interested in the linguistic structure of Spanish and/or Portuguese, bilingualism in society, and/or career in K-12 foreign language teaching, as well as for future graduate students in (Hispanic) Linguistics.</span></p>
<h4><span>Declaring the Major</span></h4>
<p>Students can receive pre-major advising at any time, from the staff undergraduate adviser. Students should declare the major when they have completed <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=SPANISH%2025" title="SPANISH 25" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'SPANISH 25');">SPANISH 25</a></span>, which must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>Students are eligible to do honors work within the Department of Spanish and Portuguese if they have completed at least two semesters of work at Berkeley with an overall grade-point average of 3.3 and a grade-point average of at least 3.6 in those courses taken within the major. Students must complete two honors courses, H195A (1.5 units) and H195B (1.5 units), in two successive semesters, and will write a thesis under the supervision of an appropriate departmental faculty member over the course of two successive semesters. A letter grade, reflecting progress, will be given after the first semester. H195A/B will not count toward the required upper division work in the major. Before the semester in which the student intends to begin the honors program, they should speak with the staff undergraduate adviser to verify eligibility for honors work and to discuss the process.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor in Hispanic Languages, Linguistics, and Bilingualism. For further information on minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>No formal declaration of enrollment in the minor program is required. Upon completion of the program, however, students must file with the undergraduate adviser of the department the <a href="http://ls-advise.berkeley.edu/fp/00minor.pdf">Petition for Confirmation of the Minor Completion form</a>. For further information on declaring the minor, please see <a href="http://spanish-portuguese.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/the-minor/">the department's website.</a></p>

Taught in Spanish, Span 101 serves as an introduction to the Spanish sound system through an exploration of the complexities of native-like Spanish pronunciation and perceptions of native and non-native accent. Designed for both native and non-native speakers of Spanish as well as students without formal coursework in (Hispanic) Linguistics, this course centers on the acoustic nuances that distinguish standard Spanish</span><span class="deschide"> pronunciation from non-standard and non-native pronunciations. Emphasis will be placed on comparisons between the Spanish and English sound systems, and the acquisition of a native-like accent will be addressed from both theoretical and practical standpoints.</span><br/>
