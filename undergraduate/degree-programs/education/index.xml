<h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The School of Education offers a minor in education for undergraduates currently enrolled at Berkeley. The minor in education provides an opportunity to examine systematically an institution that occupies a unique position in society and profoundly influences virtually everyone. This program is designed to enable students to develop a critical understanding of the relationship of education to the development of societies and individuals. Its focus is on the potential as well as the reality of diverse forms of education. The minor offers an opportunity for intellectual inquiry to broaden and complement students' work in their major fields of study. In the process, students will encounter the wide array of professional possibilities in the field of education, enabling those considering a career in the field to make an informed choice.</p>
<p>There is no undergraduate major in Education.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>In order to apply to the Education minor, students must:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Attend one of the <a href="http://gse.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-programs-undergraduate-minor-education-information-sessions">Education Minor Information Sessions</a>. These sessions, conducted by the Education Minor adviser, give background information about the minor, review requirements and guidelines, and answer questions. Information sessions are held several times during the fall and spring semesters and last from half an hour to an hour. If students are unable to attend the information sessions, they are welcome to meet with the minor adviser during office hours.</li>
	<li>Submit an online application form, available on the <a href="https://gse.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-programs-undergraduate-minor-education-applying">School of Education website</a>. Apply only after attending an information session or meeting with the Education Minor adviser. When completing the online application form, students will be asked to provide a list of courses and fieldwork they have already taken and/or plan to take to complete the requirements of the minor. This is only a plan. Students will not be required to take or use those courses for the minor.</li>
</ol>
<p>After submitting the online application, the minor adviser will automatically be notified and will review your application for completeness. Unless there are questions, the student will then be considered an Education Minor candidate. The student's email address will be added to the education minor email list so the student can be notified of opportunities in the field of education, as well as Education Minor program and course updates. The application will be processed internally—nothing will appear on the student's transcript until the minor has been completed.</p>
<p>Before submitting an application, please consider whether the education minor is something you truly intend to finish and whether you will have enough time in your schedule to take the five required courses.</p>
<p>However, do not wait until all requirements have been completed before applying. Submitting the application form early will enable the School of Education to keep students apprised of program updates and opportunities that might interest them as well as assuring that they have adequately completed the requirements.</p>

<h3>Fieldwork</h3>
<p><span class="sc_courseinline">EDUC 197</span>, the field studies courses, have a number of programs from which to choose. As there are some programs that are not approved for the minor, make sure to enroll in one of the minor-approved field sections; please consult the list available on the <a href="http://gse.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-programs-field-studies-enroll" target="_blank">School of Education website</a>. All of the sections of <span class="sc_courseinline">EDUC 197</span> are described in the Quicklist and Descriptions PDF available on the <a href="http://gse.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-programs-field-studies-enroll" target="_blank">School of Education website</a>, and in binders available at the reception counter in the Student Academic Services Office, 1600 Tolman Hall.</p>
<p>To obtain the class number for the program/section in which you are interested, contact the site coordinator for that program.</p>
<p>Students may enroll in 1, 2 or 3 units of fieldwork within one semester and may take units over multiple semesters.  Students may take all 3 units in the same field studies program or may enroll in two or three separate programs.</p>
<p>45 hours of fieldwork per semester is equivalent to 1 academic unit.</p>
<p>There are a few minor approved field studies programs outside of <span class="sc_courseinline">EDUC 197</span>. Check each semester's course list on the School of Education website for these programs.</p>
<p>Petitioning field work: There is a petition process for fieldwork that is not approved for the minor. Students will need to review the <a href="http://gse.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-programs-undergraduate-minor-education-fieldwork-petition" target="_blank">Education Minor Fieldwork Student Petition Policies &amp; Procedures</a> and submit the appropriate form.</p>
<h3>Electives</h3>
<p>Elective courses must be taken for at least 3 units.</p>
<p>A maximum of two graduate-level courses in education may be used to meet the elective requirement.</p>
<p>Students who have completed or plan to complete an education course as part of a UCB Education Abroad program may be able to have it count toward the education minor elective requirement. The course must be in the Department of Education at the University and equivalent to 3 semester credits. Notify the minor adviser if you would like to take advantage of this option.</p>
<p>From time to time, a course may be offered on campus that has significant educational content but is not on the minor approved course list. If you have found such a course and would like to have it considered for one of your electives for the minor, please contact the minor adviser about petitioning the course. A syllabus will be required.</p>

This course will explore how speaking, reading and writing are influenced by social and cultural factors. The topics include dialects, Standard English, and slang; the influence of identity on language use; and the dynamic and diverse ways in which people use language to communicate with one another and in their communities. The course will begin by exploring how people communicate within the university, or academic discourse, and how this impacts</span><span class="deschide"> academic achievement. Thus, a secondary objective is to examine literate strategies and practices of being a student that lead to higher academic achievement.</span><br/>

American sports and athletes have come to signify a complex of variegated meanings that include desire, but also disdain. Through the work of a variety of scholars, researchers, and journalists, this course explores the nature and motives of societal structures and practices (embodied in both institutions and individuals) to illuminate the intersections and reciprocal influences of society and sports. The central framework of this course draws</span><span class="deschide"> on the notion that the space of sports is defined by highly structured societal practices and consumptions. By critically analyzing a variety of these practices, this course attempts to ground a partial reading of other societal forces in American culture. In particular, the course examines the nuanced intersections of sport, race, ethnicity, social class and gender, highlighting the ways in which American sports provide a potential vehicle for social mobility and integration while simultaneously reproducing existing cultural stereotypes and structures of inequality.</span><br/>
