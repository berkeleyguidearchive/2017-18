<p>The School of Education offers a minor in education for undergraduates currently enrolled at Berkeley. The minor in education provides an opportunity to examine systematically an institution that occupies a unique position in society and profoundly influences virtually everyone. This program is designed to enable students to develop a critical understanding of the relationship of education to the development of societies and individuals. Its focus is on the potential as well as the reality of diverse forms of education. The minor offers an opportunity for intellectual inquiry to broaden and complement students' work in their major fields of study. In the process, students will encounter the wide array of professional possibilities in the field of education, enabling those considering a career in the field to make an informed choice.</p>
<p>There is no undergraduate major in Education.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>In order to apply to the Education minor, students must:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Attend one of the <a href="http://gse.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-programs-undergraduate-minor-education-information-sessions">Education Minor Information Sessions</a>. These sessions, conducted by the Education Minor adviser, give background information about the minor, review requirements and guidelines, and answer questions. Information sessions are held several times during the fall and spring semesters and last from half an hour to an hour. If students are unable to attend the information sessions, they are welcome to meet with the minor adviser during office hours.</li>
	<li>Submit an online application form, available on the <a href="https://gse.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-programs-undergraduate-minor-education-applying">School of Education website</a>. Apply only after attending an information session or meeting with the Education Minor adviser. When completing the online application form, students will be asked to provide a list of courses and fieldwork they have already taken and/or plan to take to complete the requirements of the minor. This is only a plan. Students will not be required to take or use those courses for the minor.</li>
</ol>
<p>After submitting the online application, the minor adviser will automatically be notified and will review your application for completeness. Unless there are questions, the student will then be considered an Education Minor candidate. The student's email address will be added to the education minor email list so the student can be notified of opportunities in the field of education, as well as Education Minor program and course updates. The application will be processed internally—nothing will appear on the student's transcript until the minor has been completed.</p>
<p>Before submitting an application, please consider whether the education minor is something you truly intend to finish and whether you will have enough time in your schedule to take the five required courses.</p>
<p>However, do not wait until all requirements have been completed before applying. Submitting the application form early will enable the School of Education to keep students apprised of program updates and opportunities that might interest them as well as assuring that they have adequately completed the requirements.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://gse.berkeley.edu/other/undergraduate-minor" target="_blank">Visit School Website</a></p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed before your degree date.</li>
	<li>All course work to satisfy the minor requirements must be taken at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>Three of the five required courses for the minor must be upper division. </li>
	<li>All courses used to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade, with the exception of the field work course(s).</li>
	<li>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>No more than one course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, or two minor programs.</li>
</ol>

American sports and athletes have come to signify a complex of variegated meanings that include desire, but also disdain. Through the work of a variety of scholars, researchers, and journalists, this course explores the nature and motives of societal structures and practices (embodied in both institutions and individuals) to illuminate the intersections and reciprocal influences of society and sports. The central framework of this course draws</span><span class="deschide"> on the notion that the space of sports is defined by highly structured societal practices and consumptions. By critically analyzing a variety of these practices, this course attempts to ground a partial reading of other societal forces in American culture. In particular, the course examines the nuanced intersections of sport, race, ethnicity, social class and gender, highlighting the ways in which American sports provide a potential vehicle for social mobility and integration while simultaneously reproducing existing cultural stereotypes and structures of inequality.</span><br/>

The course introduces students to relationships between research on cognitive development and reforms in elementary teaching. The syllabus is organized in modules that link research and classroom practice. For example, in a module on children's mathematics, we analyze research on children's strategies for solving math problems and consider how this research has reformed teaching practices. Students complete a project for each module that</span><span class="deschide"> links research and observations in elementary classrooms through concurrent enrollment in one unit of 197.</span><br/>
