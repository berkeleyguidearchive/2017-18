				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology offers three undergraduate major program specializations: Physiology and Metabolism, Dietetics, and Toxicology leading to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree.</p>
<p>The Physiology and Metabolism and Toxicology specializations offer ideal preparations for health-related careers such as medicine, pharmacy, optometry, and dentistry. The two curricula include many courses required for professional school admission. NST graduates who have entered health-related professional schools report appreciation for the in-depth preparation afforded by these specializations.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time to explore the sciences of nutrition and toxicology. The media have highlighted many questions about the role of diet in development and aging, the safety of genetically modified foods, links among diet, cancer, and chronic diseases, and the problems of global malnutrition.</p>
<p>The curriculum, driven by NST faculty research, covers a breadth of topics including functions and mechanisms of nutrient actions to the benefits and hazards of chemical agents, cultural and socio-economic determinants of human diets, and development of programs and policies to address human and environmental health and safety.</p>
<h3>Overview of Specializations </h3>
<p>For general information regarding the different specializations within the Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology major, please see below. For further information regarding the different requirements for each, please see the Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<h6>Physiology and Metabolism</h6>
<p>This specialization <span>provides a strong foundation in the biological and chemical sciences. The advanced course work focuses on the biochemistry and physiology of nutrients, phytochemicals, and diet-borne toxicants. The Physiology and Metabolism specialization addresses the following topics: </span><span>nutrients absorption, distribution, and metabolism; functions of nutrients in human health and disease;</span><span> cellular and molecular regulatory mechanisms by which humans respond to changes in diet; d</span><span>ietary patterns related to health and disease; conceptual and technical </span><span>processes of nutrition research.</span></p>
<h6>Dietetics</h6>
<p><span>Dietetics prepares students for a career as a Registered Dietitian (RD). RDs translate the science of nutrition into practical applications in clinical, food service, or community settings. Graduates of this program must complete a dietetics internship and pass a national examination to become an RD.</span></p>
<p><span>The Dietetics curriculum provides an excellent foundation in the biological and chemical sciences, and a preprofessional focus on applying knowledge of nutritional sciences to benefit human health and to abate disease. The Dietetics program, known formally as the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) prepares dietitians for positions of leadership in health care, education, industry, government, </span><span>and community health, as well as in professional organizations. The program fills a community need for highly trained nutrition professionals while providing academic background for graduate study in nutrition or related fields. The program focuses on excellence in intellectual development, to the development of a professional inquiring attitude, and to equality of opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span>Graduates of this program receive preprofessional verification and are eligible to apply to supervised practice programs to receive practical training in multiple aspects of dietetics practice. Such programs generally take nine to twelve months. The DPD program director assists students in applying for supervised practice programs. Upon completion of the academic course work and a postbaccalaureate program of supervised practice, students are eligible to take the nationally administered Registration Examination. Once this exam is passed, the RD credential is earned.</span></p>
<p><span>The DPD at UC Berkeley is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics Education (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND).</span></p>
<h6>Toxicology</h6>
<p><span>This specialization combines a strong foundation in biological and chemical sciences with specialized advanced courses focusing on hazardous and beneficial effects of natural and human-made toxic agents. From industrially produced environmental contaminants and designer drugs to herbs and food products, this field of study applies molecular and computational methods to better understand how these agents interact with living organisms and what should be done to ensure human health and safety.</span></p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Freshman students may apply directly to the major, or they may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. For further information regarding how to declare the major after admission including information on a change of major or change of college, please see the <a href="http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/site/forms/oisa/undergrad_handbook.pdf">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a>.</p>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p><span>Students who are interested in the honors program should apply during their junior or senior year. Students must have a 3.6 grade-point average (GPA) in order to be eligible for the honors program.  The honors program is individual research, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=NUSCTX%20H196" title="NUSCTX H196" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'NUSCTX H196');">NUSCTX H196</a></span>, for two semesters under the supervision of a faculty member. The supervised independent honors research is specific to aspects of the nutritional sciences and toxicology major, followed by an oral presentation, and written report. Acceptance in the CNR honors program is required through an application process. Please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</span></p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The department offers a minor program in Nutritional Sciences. The course work for the minor addresses topics in Human Nutrition and Nutrient Function. Elective options range from Nutrition in the Community to Metabolic Regulation to Human Diet. The minor is best suited for students already pursuing a bioscience degree: a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared to do upper division work in this field.  For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.</p>

 <p><a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/reading-composition-requirement/">Reading and Composition</a></p> <p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing and critical thinking all majors in the College require two semesters of lower division work in composition. Students must complete a first-level reading and composition course by the end of their second semester and a second-level course by the end of their fourth semester. </p> <p><a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/foreign-language-requirement/">Foreign Language</a>: <strong>EEP Majors only</strong></p> <p>The Foreign Language requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. It may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work.</p> <p><a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/natural-resources/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/">Quantitative Reasoning</a>: <strong>EEP Majors only</strong></p> <p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is only required by Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP) majors. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course.</p> <h3>Undergraduate Breadth</h3> <p>Undergraduate breadth provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. Breadth courses are built into CNR major requirements. The EEP major is the only CNR major that requires the entire 7 course breadth. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepares Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day. </p> <h3>High School Exam Credit</h3> <p>CNR students may apply high school exam credit (Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A-Level Exam) towards many College and Major Requirements. See AP Exam Equivalency Chart and Higher Level IB Exam Equivalency Chart in the <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook" target="_blank">CNR Student Handbook</a> for more information.</p> <h3>Units Requirements</h3> <p>Students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:</p> <ul> 	<li>At least 36 units must be upper division courses, including a minimum of 15 units of upper division courses in the College of Natural Resources. </li> 	<li>A maximum of 16 units of Special Studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed towards the 120 units; a maximum of four is allowed in a given semester.</li> 	<li>A maximum of 4 units of Physical Education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.</li> 	<li>Students may receive unit credit for courses graded P (including P/NP units taken through EAP) up to a limit of one-third of the total units taken and passed on the Berkeley campus at the time of graduation.</li> </ul> <h4>​Semester Unit Minimum</h4> <p>All CNR students must enroll in at least 13 units each fall and spring semester. </p> <h4>Semester Unit Maximum</h4> <p>To request permission to take more than 19.5 units in a semester, please see the major adviser.</p> <h3>Semester Limit</h3> <p>Students admitted as freshmen must graduate within 8 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p> <h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3> <p>After reaching senior status (90 semester units earned), students must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in at least two semesters in residence at the College of Natural Resources. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least four passed units. Inter-campus Visitor, Education Abroad Program, UC Berkeley Washington Program, and UC Berkeley Extension units do not count toward this requirement.</p> <p>Students may use Summer Session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that four units of coursework are completed.</p> <h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3> <p>Participants in the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) or the UC Berkeley Washington Program may meet a modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 of their final 60 semester units in residence (excluding UCEAP). At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after senior status is reached.</p> <p>Most students automatically fulfill the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to see an adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p> <h3>Grade Requirements</h3> <ul> 	<li>A 2.0 UC GPA is required for graduation.</li> 	<li>A 2.0 average in all upper division courses required of the major program is required for graduation.</li> </ul>
