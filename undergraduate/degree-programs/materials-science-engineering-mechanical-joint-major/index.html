				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The joint major programs are designed for students who wish to undertake study in two areas of engineering in order to qualify for employment in either field or for positions in which competence in two fields is required. These curricula include the core courses in each of the major fields. While they require slightly increased course loads, they can be completed in four years. </p>
<p>Students interested in the mechanical behavior of materials have the option of pursuing a joint major in Materials Science and Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. The curriculum addresses key fundamentals of both disciplines, preparing students in materials selection and design for structural and functional applications. Students completing this joint major enter professional positions in the aerospace, automotive, energy, and manufacturing industries, along with many others.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Joint Major</h3>
<p>Admission directly to a joint major is closed to freshmen and junior transfer applicants. Students interested in a joint program may apply to change majors during specific times in their academic progress. Please see the <a href="http://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/majors-minors/joint-majors">College of Engineering joint majors website</a> for complete details.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

				<a name="majorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Major Requirements</h2><p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for all work undertaken at UC Berkeley.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required for all technical courses taken in satisfaction of major requirements.</p>

Entering junior transfers are allowed a maximum of four semesters to complete their degree requirements. (Note: junior transfers admitted missing three or more courses from the lower division curriculum are allowed five semesters.) Summer terms are optional and do not count toward the maximum.

This requirement, built into all the engineering programs of study, includes two reading and composition courses (R&amp;C), and four additional courses within which a number of specific conditions must be satisfied. Follow these guidelines to fulfill this requirement:</p> <ol> 	<li>Complete a minimum of six courses from the  approved <a href="http://coe.berkeley.edu/hssreq" target="_blank">Humanities/Social Sciences (H/SS) lists</a>. </li> 	<li>Courses must be a minimum of 3 semester units (or 4 quarter units).</li> 	<li>Two of the six courses must fulfill the college's Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) requirement. These courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required) and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (fourth semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B&quot; course, must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year.

This course is intended to give students the opportunity to expand their knowledge of topics related to biomedical materials selection and design. Structure-property relationships of biomedical materials and their interaction with biological systems will be addressed. Applications of the concepts developed include blood-materials compatibility, biomimetic materials, hard and soft tissue-materials interactions, drug delivery, tissue engineering</span><span class="deschide">, and biotechnology.</span><br/>

<div id="958" class="coursedetails" aria-expanded="false">
<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives  Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
<br/>
• Design experiments and analyze data from the literature in the context of the class design project.<br/>
Apply core concepts in materials science to solve engineering problems related to the selection biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance.<br/>
Develop an understanding of the social, safety and medical consequences of biomaterial use and regulatory issues associated with the selection of biomaterials in the context of the silicone breast implant controversy and subsequent biomaterials crisis.<br/>
Work independently and function on a team, and develop solid communication skills (oral, graphic &amp; written) through the class design project.<br/>
• Understanding of the origin of surface forces and interfacial free energy, and how they contribute to the development of the biomaterial interface and ultimately biomaterial performance.<br/>

This is an introductory course on the finite element method and is intended for seniors in engineering and applied science disciplines. The course covers the basic topics of finite element technology, including domain discretization, polynomial interpolation, application of boundary conditions, assembly of global arrays, and solution of the resulting algebraic systems. Finite element formulations for several important field equations are</span><span class="deschide"> introduced using both direct and integral approaches. Particular emphasis is placed on computer simulation and analysis of realistic engineering problems from solid and fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetism. The course uses FEMLAB, a multiphysics MATLAB-based finite element program that possesses a wide array of modeling capabilities and is ideally suited for instruction. Assignments will involve both paper- and computer-based exercises. Computer-based assignments will emphasize the practical aspects of finite element model construction and analysis.</span><br/>
