				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate degree program in African American Studies exposes students to the social, political, and cultural history of African-descended people in the modern world. While its primary focus is on the United States, the program’s conceptual framework places African Americans within a broader global, diasporic dialogue about the evolving function of race in history as well as in the contemporary moment. With its interdisciplinary strengths in history, culture, and social and political institutions, the major provides students with skills in research, criticism, and writing that our graduates have taken to a variety of professional paths, including teaching, government and policy work, employment in mass media, professional schools (law, medicine, business), and graduate study in multiple fields.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Completion of, or enrollment in, the three following courses is required in order to declare the major: <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%204A" title="AFRICAM 4A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 4A');">AFRICAM 4A</a></span>, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205A" title="AFRICAM 5A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5A');">AFRICAM 5A</a></span>, and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%205B" title="AFRICAM 5B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM 5B');">AFRICAM 5B</a></span>. For details regarding how to declare the major, please see the <a href="http://africam.berkeley.edu/content/major-requirements" target="_blank">department's website</a>.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for admission to the honors program, a student must have completed at least two semesters at UC Berkeley and have attained senior standing with a GPA of 3.3 or higher in all University work, as well as a 3.5 GPA or higher in the African American Studies major. Students in the program must complete two consecutive semesters of African American Studies <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20H195A" title="AFRICAM H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM H195A');">AFRICAM H195A</a></span>-<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=AFRICAM%20H195B" title="AFRICAM H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'AFRICAM H195B');">AFRICAM H195B</a></span> under the supervision of a faculty member, culminating in the completion of a senior honors thesis.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of African American American Studies offers an undergraduate minor in African American Studies. To apply for the minor, students must submit the departmental minor application, which may be obtained from 660 Barrows or <a href="http://africam.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/UG%20Minor%20App.pdf" target="_blank" title="Requirements for the African American Studies Minor">online</a>. After completion of the minor requirements, students must submit the Petition for Confirmation of Minor Program form, which may be obtained either at 664A Barrows or <a href="http://africam.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/aasminor.pdf" target="_blank" title="COMPLETION OF L&amp;S MINOR">online</a>. Both the departmental application and the Confirmation of Minor Program form should be submitted during the semester in which a student is completing course work for the minor. Please see the undergraduate adviser for advising while pursuing the minor program. </p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://africam.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>

In this course, we will read books by acclaimed African American poets who h­ave won Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards, and commendations from the Library of Congress. We will also examine book reviews, articles, and interviews that illuminate popular and critical responses to these authors and their work. The course is designed to teach students how different poems function—through close reading, and careful attention to poems’ formal properties. Hard</span><span class="deschide"> work is required; love of the genre and confidence in one’s ability to understand it is not (as the former U.S. Poet Laureate, Natasha Trethewey, admitted recently in an interview “growing up, I didn't think I could understand poetry, I didn't think that it had any relevance to my life”).</span><br/>

The purpose of this course is to examine the many forms that the struggle of minorities can assume. The focus is on individual struggle and its outcome as reported and perceived by the individuals themselves. Members of three minority aggregates are considered: African Americans, Asian Americans (so called), and Chicano/Latino Americans. The choice of these three has to do with the different histories of members of these aggregrates. Such differences</span><span class="deschide"> have produced somewhat different approaches to struggle.</span><br/>
