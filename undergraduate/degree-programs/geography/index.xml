<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The undergraduate major in Geography is unusually broad and diverse, including the study of cultural, economic, political, historical, biophysical, urban and regional geography as well as cartography, quantitative methods, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and field work. Backgrounds in the natural and social sciences, history, and statistical methods may be useful to the geography major, with the mix and emphasis depending on the student's particular interests. Lower division requirements ensure that all students gain a broad understanding of the discipline, while upper division requirements are structured to allow students to specialize in the areas of their greatest interest.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students may declare the Geography major after they have completed two of the three lower division requirements, completed at least 30 units, have a C (2.0) cumulative grade point average (GPA), and no prior infraction of the <a href="http://geography.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-studies/major-and-minor-program-details/">Undergraduate Code of Ethics and Climate Standard</a>. Students should declare by the end of their sophomore year at Berkeley or by the start of their second semester if they are a transfer student. To declare, make an online appointment with the student academic adviser here: http://ensor.youcanbook.me. </p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with an overall GPA of 3.5 or higher on all work completed at the University, and an average of 3.5 in courses taken in the Geography Department, may apply for the honors program, with the consent of a departmental adviser. The application should be made at the beginning of the senior year. A senior in the honors program must complete <span class="sc_courseinline">GEOG H195A</span> and/or <span class="sc_courseinline">GEOG H195B</span> consecutively, in which a thesis is required (usually over two semesters). Any faculty member in the department may administer an honors course. It is suggested that students approach faculty members with whom they have taken classes about mentorship during junior year. After deciding on the number of units (1-4 units) the student wishes to undertake, the student should see the student academic adviser for a course control number (CCN) and the departmental application. Upon successful completion of the program and graduation, the designation of &quot;with Honors,&quot; &quot;with High Honors,&quot; or &quot;with Highest Honors” will be noted on the student's transcript and diploma.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department offers a Minor in Geography. Upon completion of all the requirements for the minor, students must see the academic adviser to fill out the “Confirmation of Minor Program” petition. Students should plan on filing this petition with the adviser during the finals week of the semester in which the last course is taken.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Role of Space: Understand the function of boundaries, territories, places, networks, and other spatial forms in the workings of human societies.</li>
		<li>Power and landscapes: Understand the projection, protection, and contestation of power through the production of ideas, cultures, empires, and spatial forms.</li>
		<li>Roles of cities: Grasp the roles and forms of cities as records and motors of modern life, and the interactions of urban areas with hinterlands and global networks.</li>
		<li>Food systems: Compare and contrast agrarian and industrial food supply systems around the world.</li>
		<li>Society-environment interactions: Understand the mutual influences and ramifications of biophysical and social processes in the dynamics of societies at scales from the local to the global.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Analysis and application for students who choose the Earth Systems Science track
	<ol>
		<li>Earth system science: Analyze interconnected environmental systems with process-based geophysical, geochemical, and biological sciences in the context of current social environmental problems.</li>

	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Application of basic skills in research, knowledge of literature, analysis, and communication
	<ol>
		<li>Write clearly: Demonstrate ability to focus and elaborate on chosen topics.</li>
		<li>Read critically: Critically analyze and assess arguments in professional journals, public media, and advocacy literature.</li>
		<li>Empirical plus theoretical: Produce work with robust empirical research (that locates, interprets, and puts together relevant and reliable sources of information) as well as intellectual and theoretical rigor.</li>
		<li>Use of mapping: Understand the production, interpretation, and use of mapping in all its forms and scales.</li>
		<li>Applying quantitative skills: Apply basic quantitative skills such as statistics, algebra, and interpreting graphs.</li>
		<li>Analytical ability: Demonstrate analytical ability: including the ability to identify questions, differentiate descriptions from explanations, make connections between empirical observations and arguments, and differentiate between competing explanations of a given phenomenon.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Lifetime skills
	<ol>
		<li>Continuing concern: Show continuing concern, curiosity, and zeal for geography and for applying geographical understanding.</li>
		<li>Representing geography: Represent the usefulness of geography and geographical points of view to—depending on the circumstances—prospective employers, educators, policy makers, resource managers, developers, engineers, the public, and acquaintances.</li>

Geography is a way of thinking deeply and expansively about the world we inhabit and this course is designed to transform how you think about, understand and engage in its makings and re-makings.  Ideas central to the field of geography such as space, nature, empire and globalization animate the histories and politics of each of these issues and many other cases.  Our approach will not be to simply learn about the regions of the world, but to think</span><span class="deschide"> critically and geographically about how region's, peoples and states and other foundational concepts have come into being and how they might be otherwise.</span><br/>

The intersection of nature, identity, and politics pepper the pages of newspapers almost every day from stories of toxic waste sites, crime, genetic engineering to indigenous struggles, and terrorist tendencies.

The goals of this introductory Earth System Science course are to achieve a scientific understanding of important problems in global environmental change and to learn how to analyze a complex system using scientific methods. Earth System Science is an interdisciplinary field that describes the cycling of energy and matter between the different spheres (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, and lithosphere) of the earth system. Under</span><span class="deschide"> the overarching themes of human-induced climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and biodiversity loss, we will explore key concepts of solar radiation, plate tectonics, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the history of life on Earth.</span><br/>

How does the chemical makeup of Earth make it suitable for life? And how does life in turn alter the chemistry of our planet? Biogeochemistry is the field of science that explores the imprint of biota (including humans) on the chemistry of the ocean, land and atmosphere. This interdisciplinary field addresses global problems, including climate change feedbacks, air quality, land use change, and marine ecosystem health. We will provide an overview</span><span class="deschide"> of the major biogeochemical cycles, discuss the biogeochemistry of major ecosystems, and introduce the major biogeochemical questions being asked today.

This course provides a very basic description of atmospheric physics and dynamics at the large scale, followed by region-specific climate systems and response. We examine the inter-relationships between the role of climate variations and change to impacts, risk and adaptation. Each week's reading will be integrated into class participation with examples from recent weather events. Class begins with a brief weather review that focuses on a specific geographic</span><span class="deschide"> region, followed by the topic of the day, a break, and class discussion of weather events and impacts related to the topic. There will be four homework sets, four quizzes, a mid-term and final exam.</span><br/>

This course seeks to trace the rise of the anthropogenic epoch as a political epistemology, changing material milieu, and amorphous and contested political signifier. The notion of the Anthropocene challenges the very boundaries of nature and culture that have plagued and defined modernity. Natural forces and inanimate objects from storms and bodies, ocean flows and river currents, soil layers and chemical reactions are more and more commonly understood as always</span><span class="deschide"> already natural/cultural. What are the differential ways that the universal categories of the human at the heart of the concept of the Anthropocene mask the differential responsibility and liability for these epochal changes?<br/></span><br/>
