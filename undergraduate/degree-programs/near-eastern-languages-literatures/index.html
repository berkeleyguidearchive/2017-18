It reviews sources of evidence and interpretive frameworks for understanding the public and private roles of women and the definition of gender in ancient Egypt. It also places the women</span><span class="deschide"> of ancient Egypt and ancient Egyptian gender constructions into comparative contexts with other ancient eastern Mediterranean and Near Eastern societies.</span><br/>

The most famous of Babylonian heroes is Gilgamesh, King of Uruk. The Gilgamesh Epic, recorded on twelve tablets in cuneiform, follows him in his quest for fame and eternal life. In this course, we will read the Gilgamesh Epic as well as several earlier texts around the same character. Moreover, we will read additional ancient texts that elucidate one or another aspect of the Epic. We will follow the traditions around Gilgamesh and see how his</span><span class="deschide"> fame was used for literary, religious, and political purposes. Finally, we will look at some of the modern Gilgamesh interpretations.</span><br/>

This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological</span><span class="deschide"> remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.</span><br/>
