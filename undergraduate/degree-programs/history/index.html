				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of History offers a program of instruction ranging widely over the historical record of human experience. The chronological, geographical, and topical range affords great flexibility to students working toward degrees in history and to those who wish to give a historical dimension to their studies in other disciplines. History at Berkeley is a highly flexible major that allows students to follow their interests. It is also a major that places strong value on original student research, with all students completing capstone projects on topics they choose in consultation with members of the faculty.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>Students may declare the major after completing three letter-graded courses in the Department of History with a 2.0 grade-point average (GPA) or better. This must include at least two lower division courses.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To graduate with honors in History, a major must achieve a general GPA of 3.5, a departmental GPA of 3.7, and a minimum grade of &quot;A-&quot; in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%20101" title="HISTORY 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY 101');">HISTORY 101</a></span>. To be eligible for graduation with high or highest honors in History, a major must achieve a general GPA of 3.5, a departmental GPA of 3.7, and a grade of &quot;A&quot; in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%20101" title="HISTORY 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY 101');">HISTORY 101</a></span>. The student must also receive a nomination for high or highest honors from the 101 instructor. The decision to award high or highest honors rests with the Honors Committee.</p>
<p>A major who is eligible for honors after completing <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%20101" title="HISTORY 101" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY 101');">HISTORY 101</a></span> and is interested in continued research may pursue a second thesis project under the rubric <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=HISTORY%20H195" title="HISTORY H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'HISTORY H195');">HISTORY H195</a></span>. The second project may substitute for the 101 thesis in determining eligibility for high or highest honors if the student meets the GPA standards and receives a nomination from the H195 instructor.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of History offers a minor in History.</p>
<p><span>Students are encouraged to meet with the minor adviser to file a &quot;History Minor Application&quot; as soon as they have completed one course towards the minor. In addition to turning in the application, students who have taken their lower division minor course elsewhere should provide an unofficial copy of the transcript showing the course that satisfies the minor and the grade received.</span></p>
<p>All students must submit a completed “History Minor Application” and an L&amp;S “Minor Completion” petition by the minor declaration deadline once they have enrolled in or completed the course that will complete the minor. The deadline is May first for the spring and November first for the fall. The application and completion forms may be submitted simultaneously. </p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://history.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

<h3>Field of Concentration Requirement</h3>
<p>At least four of the eight upper-division courses must constitute a Field of Concentration, which shall be defined by one of the following rubrics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a period (such as “The Ancient World,” “The Medieval World,” “The Twentieth Century,” or a similarly broad temporal span)</li>
	<li>a geographical area (such as “Eastern Europe,” “China,” “The Mediterranean,” or a similarly broad spatial expanse)</li>
	<li>a thematic approach (such as “Science and Medicine,” “Law,” “Popular Culture,” “Religion,” or a similarly broad subject matter)</li>
</ul>
<p>The four courses constituting the Field of Concentration must include History 101.The three additional courses in the Field may include a course from the History 103 series. They may also include one appropriate upper-division course (of at least three units) from another department (in consultation with the Undergraduate Advisor.)</p>
<h3><span>Pre-Modern Requirement</span></h3>
<p>At least one course used to fulfill the major requirements must be devoted entirely to pre-modern history, to be selected from courses focused on one or more of the following eras: antiquity, the classical period, and the medieval period. Courses dealing solely with the early modern period do not satisfy this requirement.</p>

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The History minor consists of six four-unit courses: one lower division and five upper division, from at least two of the seven historical fields below.</li>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for a letter grade.</li>
	<li>All of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the History minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which you plan to graduate. If you cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, please see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed within the unit ceiling. (For further information regarding the unit ceiling, please see the College Requirements website.)</li>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The History major helps students learn to think critically and deeply about the historical processes that have shaped the world we live in. History majors are exposed to a temporally and geographically broad range of historical experience, but they are also required to concentrate on a world region or theme or a period in history, both in order to develop depth of understanding and in order to prepare for the capstone of the History Major: an article-length, primary-source based, original research project. The major is designed to develop critical reading, thinking, and writing skills that will be needed to succeed in this capstone course.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Distinguish and characterize significant periods of historical experience in multiple societies from different parts of the globe.</li>
	<li>Describe events and developments in the history of multiple societies in terms of continuity, change, and causation.</li>
	<li>Understand interpretive debates about the past.</li>
	<li>Appreciate the complexities involved in interpreting societies and social change: for example, the local and the global, particular and general, contingent and structural.</li>
	<li>Identify different kinds of historical evidence and understand their role in the production of historical knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Recall factual claims about the past and synthesize them into coherent interpretive arguments.</li>
	<li>Read documents closely and critically.</li>
	<li>Formulate a well-organized, well-supported argument.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate clear writing in the form of essays of varying lengths.</li>
	<li>Make cogent oral arguments about reading assignments in the context of a seminar discussion.</li>
	<li>Conduct original research with primary sources.</li>
	<li>Locate good, relevant secondary scholarship, and distinguish good from poor scholarship.</li>
	<li>Observe ethical practices of citation and intellectual self-presentation.</li>
</ol>

In this connector course, we will explore how historical data becomes historical evidence and how recent technological advances affect long-established practices, such as close attention to historical context and contingency. Will the advent of fast computing and big data make history “count” more or lead to unprecedented insights into the study of change over time? During our weekly discussions, we will apply what we learn in lectures and</span><span class="deschide"> labs to the analysis of selected historical sources and get an understanding of constructing historical datasets. We will also consider scholarly debates over quantitative evidence and historical argument.</span><br/>

We will have two projects in this course. The first of these is to understand, in so far as the sources permit, the nature of state structure in the Indian area between 1000 and 1800 CE. The second of these is to look at the way in which historians have described the history and the society of this period to understand the way in which the Indian state and its society has been constructed. This will involve reading in both substantive texts and</span><span class="deschide"> theoretical works.</span><br/>

Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of</span><span class="deschide"> women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the &quot;subaltern&quot; classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.</span><br/>

It is impossible to understand Chinese history and culture without knowing what ordinary people thought, felt, and believed. In this course, our primary concerns will be 1) the built environment -- village form, houses, temples; 2) village festivals and domestic rituals; 3) the rituals and scriptures of local cults; 4) operas, storytelling, and other forms of village entertainment; and 5) popular visual arts. These subjects will be studied</span><span class="deschide"> through both written and visual documentation.</span><br/>

In this course we will be discussing key developments in U.S. thought since the middle of the nineteenth century, roughly beginning with the reception of Darwin. The broader story told in the class weaves together in the history of science and engineering, the arts and popular culture, philosophy, and education. Our goal is to trace how ideas, whether they are dominant, challenging, or look back, have affected the ways in which Americans</span><span class="deschide"> live together. We will look at how intellectual life has empowered and expanded the capacity of Americans to understand their world and achieve goals more effectively.

For most of human history, urban living has been the experience of a distinct minority. Only in the past two hundred years have the physicial spaces, social relations, and lifestyles associated with large cities entered the mainstream. This course examines the long century of urban growth between 1825 and 1933, when big cities came into being in the United States. Focusing on large metropolitian centers (especially on New York, Chicago, and</span><span class="deschide"> San Francisco), we will study the way urban spaces provided sites and sources of new modes of personal interaction, popular entertainment, social conflict, and political expression.</span><br/>

World War II lifted the U.S. from the Great Depression and launched a long economic boom that helped underwrite and propel efforts on behalf of greater racial equality and economic equity. As that boom began to fade in the late 1960s, America’s march toward greater racial equality foundered, while its march toward greater economic equity began to reverse course. The Civil Rights Era gave way to the New Gilded Age. This course will explore the political, legal, and</span><span class="deschide"> economic history of America’s struggles for racial equality and economic equity – and the relationship between them.</span><br/>

This course surveys Cuban history, culture, and politics from the 15th century to the present. We will examine both the outsized role the island has played in world history and the dramatic ways world history has refracted through the island’s turbulent past. How has Cuban history and culture been shaped by its unique position in global geopolitics, at the crossroads of Europe, the Americas, and Africa? How have inhabitants of Cuba struggled against ongoing relationships</span><span class="deschide"> of colonialism and dependency with foreign powers? How have inhabitants of Cuba defined what it means to be Cuban both because of and in spite of these global forces? We will draw on a wide array of texts from long before the famous Revolution of 1959 to well after.</span><br/>

The eighteenth century in Europe witnessed a series of &quot;revolutions&quot;--intellectual, political, and to a lesser extent, social and economic--that together constitute the birth rites of modern European society and culture. Historians collectively agree that the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the European expansion of Napoleonic France were events of world-historical significance, yet the causes and precise meaning of these</span><span class="deschide"> events are the subjects of substantial disagreement. We will study the transformations of the eighteenth century that announced our modern world, and we will also try to make sense of the different ways that historians disagree about the meaning of what happened.</span><br/>

Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the Soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and from there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented</span><span class="deschide">, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy.<br/>
The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of World War II.<br/></span><br/>

This upper division course looks at the rise and fall of the European great powers from the Peace of Westphalia, traditionally perceived as the beginning of the modern states system, to the coming of the First World War, an era of state and empire building. Economic and technological trends are naturally part of the story as well as cultural, social, and political forces. At the same time, the course highlights the decisive influence of the shakers and movers--kings</span><span class="deschide">, emperors, and generals.</span><br/>

Europe has experienced three revolutions in the past two centuries. The first was political, the second was economic, and the third was what Raymond Williams called the &quot;cultural revolution&quot; - the dramatic shift from a largely oral and iconographic world to one of universal literacy and the technology of modern communications. By means of readings, lectures, discussions, films and slides, the class will examine the meaning of the</span><span class="deschide"> revolutionary change for the lives of ordinary men and women, as well as the responses of selected writers, artists, and social theorists to the culture of democratization.</span><br/>

We begin with the French Revolution, one of the truly earth-shaking events in history, and then we follow French history through a series of monarchical, authoritarian, and democratic regimes. In the process, we will also trace the emergence, expansion and decline of a great colonial empire. Issues of focus include French cultural and intellectual life; empire as a way of life not</span><span class="deschide"> only for colonists but also for those living in mainland France; religion; immigration; battles over “who is French”; and dramatic changes in French economy and society during the past two centuries.</span><br/>

This course provides the essential foundation for understanding the catastrophic history of Germany in the 20th Century, as well as some of its successes. A central theme is the struggle to define and impose a single national identity on socially, culturally, and religiously diverse peoples in an age of Great Power conflict. Although the region now known as Germany will be the focus of our investigation, considerable attention will also be paid</span><span class="deschide"> to the Hapsburg Empire, for until 1866 Austria was officially a part of &quot;Germany&quot; and remained, for nearly a century thereafter, culturally and in popular consciousness a part of a &quot;Greater Germany.&quot;</span><br/>

This course provides an introduction to Germany’s experience of the twentieth century, analyzed through the social and cultural history of its modern metropolis. Pivotal site for the collapse of four different Germanies between 1918 and 1989, Berlin has been the capital of imperialism, war and revolution, democracy, social reform and cultural experimentation, Nazism, genocide and urban warfare, Cold War division, student radicalism in the West and Soviet-style Socialism</span><span class="deschide"> in the East, and finally re-united Germany, haunted by the presence of the past.</span><br/>

This course will focus on the history of Italy during a period when it was the leading center of European artistic and cultural production and the driving force in the revival of classical learning and literary ideals. This was the Italy of Raphael and Michelangelo, Ariosto and Alberti, Brunelleschi and Botticelli. At the same time, Italy was also a political battleground through most of this period, both in the realm of ideas and theory but</span><span class="deschide"> also in a literal sense. It was in Italy that &quot;the art of war,&quot; as Machiavelli called it, took center stage as the peninsula became one of the major theaters of war between the great powers of the age, France and Spain. The course will combine a study of the artistic, intellectual, religious, and political history of Italy in this period both as it developed internally and as it was related to the rest of Europe and the Mediterranean world. Requirements will include a midterm, a final, and an optional final paper.</span><br/>

In 1721, Peter the Great chose the title of Emperor for himself, and declared that Russia would be an Empire. The empire lasted until the revolutions of 1917, but was never entirely stable. The Romanovs believed that autocracy was the key to good governance. Yet, the reigns of almost all the Romanov Emperors were marked by coups d'etat, peasant rebellions, and, later, assassination attempts. Russia's expanding boundaries and growing population</span><span class="deschide"> made it even more difficult to rule. This course will focus heavily on political history and political thought. Given the many factors that were tearing Peter's Empire apart, it will ask, what held it together for so many years?</span><br/>

The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e.</span><span class="deschide">, on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the &quot;outside&quot; world, and how these crises were resolved.

In this course we explore the intersections of art and science in medieval, modern, and contemporary history. Our aim is twofold. First, to explore the close interaction between these two fields, and the way in which they have shaped each other through the ages. Second, to focus our attention on specific instances of art/science interaction, using them as prisms through which one can reach a fuller understanding of major historical transformations.</span><br/>

This course will explore magic as an experimental science within the learned traditions of civilizations that we consider as fundamental for a modern Western identity: from ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome to the medieval and early modern Middle East, Byzantium, and Europe. The primary sources used for this exploration will be texts on demons, magic, divination, and the sophisticated philosophical background to such beliefs. In addition, archeological</span><span class="deschide"> remains pertinent to these practices such as talismans, amulets, and other magical objects will be discussed.</span><br/>

Whether you call it soccer, football or futebol the beautiful game with the round ball is played and watched around the world. This class will explore how and why that came to happen. Along the way it will trace key developments in the game such as the formation of clubs, international tournaments, the development of stadiums, fan culture, media coverage, formations and styles of play, gambling and corruption, the working conditions and wages</span><span class="deschide"> of players. We will locate these changes in broader historical processes – political, economic, social and cultural - that have transformed the game and made it a global commodity.
