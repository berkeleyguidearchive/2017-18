<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Berkeley offers an interdisciplinary undergraduate program leading to a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in film. The program offers rigorous engagement with the entire culture of moving-images, teaching students to think historically, theoretically and analytically about a wide range of cinematic forms. At the same time, it encourages students to look at moving images from the vantage point of other disciplines. To this end, the Department of Film and Media cooperates with a number of other departments and programs on campus. Students earning their BA in film may also choose to complement their study of the history and theory of moving images with the hands-on experience provided by production classes.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>To declare a major in film, students must have completed a minimum of 30 units, and have satisfactorily completed <span class="sc_courseinline">FILM 25A</span> or <span class="sc_courseinline">FILM 25B</span>. For further information regarding prerequisites, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>To be eligible for admission to the honors program in film, a student must have attained senior standing with a grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher on all University work and a 3.5 GPA or higher in courses in the major. The levels of honors are as follows: honors, high honors, and highest honors. Students in the honors program are to take <span class="sc_courseinline">FILM H195</span> for a letter grade to complete a senior honors thesis. Although the production of a film may be part of the preparation of the thesis — and the film may be submitted as a documentation or example — it is expected that the thesis will be a substantial piece of writing on film criticism or film history.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>There is no minor program in film.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>In addition to the University, campus, and college requirements, listed on the College Requirements tab, students must fulfill the below requirements specific to their major program.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the major requirements below must be taken for graded credit, other than courses listed which are offered on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis only. Other exceptions to this requirement are noted as applicable.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs, with the exception of minors offered outside of the College of Letters &amp; Science.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 must be maintained in both upper and lower division courses used to fulfill the major requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>For information regarding residence requirements and unit requirements, please see the College Requirements tab.</p>
<h3>Language Requirement</h3>
<p><strong>Film majors have two options for completing their language requirement ( this will only apply to students admitted before Fall 2017 ):</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Students may complete the third semester of a college-level language course in a single language.</li>
	<li>Students may choose to complete the second semester of a college-level language course in two different languages. If a student has taken three or more years of a language in high school, that language can count as one of the two languages. In this case, students are required to only complete the second semester of one additional language.</li>
</ol>
<p>Language courses which are strictly conversational are not acceptable. Students may enroll in the courses being used to satisfy the film language requirement on a <em>Pass/No Pass</em> basis. Students should be aware that if they are also using the course to satisfy the foreign language requirement, it must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Any natural language is acceptable. Students who are native speakers of a language other than English may demonstrate their language competency by satisfactorily passing a language proficiency exam administered by a language department at UC Berkeley or by taking an advanced course in the language (such as an upper division course which is taught in the language). Students are expected to demonstrate both verbal and written proficiency.</p>
<p><strong>New Requirements beginning Fall 2017 ( All incoming freshman and newly admitted transfers will be held to the new language policy ):</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Students may complete the second semester or higher of a college-level language course in one language, which have to be taken at the UC Berkeley Campus (this means French 2, German 2, etc. or higher: French 102 or another upper division course taught in the target language). Students should take a course at the appropriate level. Student with no language background will take the firs and second semester sequence in one language. </li>
	<li>The class must be taken for a letter grade and with minimum of a B- grade or better.  </li>
	<li>There will be no waivers or credit given for courses completed in high school or at community college. Film majors have to take at least one language course at UC Berkeley, second-semester level or higher as appropriate to their background, in order to pass the requirement. The requirement cannot be completed at an outside institution (with the exception of UC-approved study abroad programs). This rule also applies for transfer students who took a four- semester sequence at community college, students must enroll in one further language course at Berkeley, preferably an upper division language. course. </li>
	<li>Native speakers of another language may request a waiver by filling in a form with details about their linguistic heritage.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>After completing the film major, a student will have a working knowledge of the film-making process from concept to exhibition and will be able to interpret films through a variety of aesthetic, cultural, historical, and theoretical frameworks. The critical thinking skills promoted in the film major involve seeing beyond one’s immediate reactions to a film by developing a repertoire of productive interpretive questions and approaches that lead to more complex understanding and appreciation of the filmic experience. Analytic reasoning is encouraged in both oral and written assignments that require students to perform systematic analysis of film sequences, to construct careful, step-by-step arguments in larger research projects, or to create a coherently constructed film or script. Communication skills are developed through participation in classroom discussions, in the effective writing of critical essays and research papers, and in the articulation of creative ideas through film-making and scriptwriting.</p>
<p>More specifically, the successful graduate from the film major must be able to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Do a shot-and-sequence analysis both orally in class and in a written form.</li>
	<li>Creatively re-edit a sequence from a silent film.</li>
	<li>Think beyond the surface impressions of popular films by developing a repertoire of critical questions and approaches that facilitate deeper understanding.</li>
	<li>Analyze and write about alternative kinds of moving images (silent, avant-garde, documentary, foreign-language, art films).</li>
	<li>Identify the major movements in film history.</li>
	<li>Talk and write about how an individual film fits within this history and the mode of production from which it emerges.</li>
	<li>Situate the major movements of cinema within a broader socio-historical context.</li>
	<li>Describe the major cinematic genres, and analyze an individual film as an example of one or more of these genres.</li>
	<li>Summarize the arguments for and against the notion of film authorship, and talk knowledgeably about the work of at least one director.</li>
	<li>Describe a number of different theoretical approaches to film.</li>
	<li>Utilize this theoretical knowledge when analyzing a film, making a film, and writing a screenplay.</li>
	<li>Write essays and papers that are clear, well-researched and organized, and that mount an original argument.</li>
	<li>Organize ideas in oral presentations and general classroom discussions.</li>
</ol>

This course is a survey of the history and aesthetics of the international film Avant-Garde from the 1920s to the present. The course explores the development of a range of experimental film forms and practices, situating them in relation to the larger artistic, social, and intellectual contexts in which they arise. We look at the ways artists have not only created new film languages in order to express their unique ideas</span><span class="deschide"> and vision, but also how they inverted alternative modes of production, distribution, and exhibition for their work. We examine the major formal modes of Avant-Garde cinema, moving between historical and current developments.</span><br/>
