<![CDATA[
<p>Minor programs are areas of concentration requiring fewer courses than an undergraduate major. These programs are optional, but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.</p>
<p>All the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.</p>
<p>Applicants can apply after second semester sophomore year and up to first semester senior year. Applicants who have completed all of the courses prior to applying will not be accepted into the minor; <strong>students must apply first</strong>.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum technical grade point average of 3.0 (math, science &amp; engineering courses) is required for acceptance into the minor program.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Please see more details at the <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/bioeminor" target="_blank">department website</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<div>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
</div>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Students should apply first, before taking courses.</strong> Applications are available in 306 Stanley Hall or <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/bioeminor">on the department website</a>. Completed applications should be returned to 306 Stanley Hall. Please include an unofficial copy of your transcript with the application.</li>
	<li>The department will approve or deny the application. If approved, the department will contact the student via email advising of the decision.</li>
	<li>Upon completion of the requirements for the minor, the student should complete the <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/bioeminor">Confirmation of Completion form</a>. Please submit the form along with an unofficial transcript to 306 Stanley Hall.</li>
	<li>The department will verify the completion of the minor and send the original form to the Office of the Registrar. (Note: for graduating seniors, this must be done no later than two weeks after the end of the term.)</li>
	<li>A notation in the memorandum section of the student’s transcript will indicate completion of the minor.</li>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<div id="stcpDiv">
<p>Since our founding in 1998, the BioE faculty have been working to create an integrated, comprehensive program. Much thought has been put into the question, “What does every bioengineer need to know?” The faculty have been engaged in considerable dialogue over the years about what needs to be included, in what order, and how to do so in a reasonable time frame. Balancing depth with breadth has been the key challenge, and we have reached a point where the pieces have come together to form a coherent bioengineering discipline.</p>
</div>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Describe the fundamental principles and methods of engineering.</li>
	<li>Understand the physical, chemical, and mathematical basis of biology.</li>
	<li>Appreciate the different scales of biological systems.</li>
	<li>Apply the physical sciences and mathematics in an engineering approach to biological systems.</li>
	<li>Effectively communicate scientific and engineering data and ideas, both orally and in writing.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate the values of cooperation, teamwork, social responsibility, and lifelong learning necessary for success in the field.</li>
	<li>Design a bioengineering solution to a problem of technical, scientific. or societal importance.</li>
	<li>Demonstrate advanced knowledge in a specialized field of bioengineering.</li>
</ol>

<h3><span>Undergraduate Research</span></h3>
<p>We believe it is essential for undergraduates to experience the hands-on application of skills to prepare them for a career in bioengineering. Every student is required to complete at least one semester of research or design before graduation, although most do more. This can be accomplished through our outstanding <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/capstone" target="_blank">senior capstone design course</a>, or through other independent study options and research in faculty laboratories. A recent survey shows that 94% of our senior students have undertaken extracurricular research, usually starting in their sophomore year. For research resources, please visit the <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/undergradresearch" target="_blank">department website</a>.</p>
<h3>Student Organizations</h3>
<p>There are several active student organizations related to bioengineering, focusing on academics, research, global healthcare, local outreach, social life, career planning, and other worthy efforts. For further information, please see the <a href="http://bioeng.berkeley.edu/resources/student-life">Student Life</a> page on the department website.</p>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives  Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course is separated into four parts spanning the principles of synthetic materials and surfaces, principles of biological materials, biological performance of materials and devices, and state-of-the-art materials design. Students are required to attend class and master the material therein. In addition, readings from the clinical, life and materials science literature are assigned. Students are encouraged to seek out additional reference material to complement the readings assigned. A mid-term examination is given on basic principles (parts 1 and 2 of the outline). A comprehensive final examination is given as well. <br/>The purpose of this course is to introduce students to problems associated with the selection and function of biomaterials. Through class lectures and readings in both the physical and life science literature, students will gain broad knowledge of the criteria used to select biomaterials, especially in devices where the material-tissue or material-solution interface dominates performance. Materials used in devices for medicine, dentistry, tissue engineering, drug delivery, and the biotechnology industry will be addressed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>This course also has a significant design component (~35%). Students will form small teams (five or less) and undertake a semester-long design project related to the subject matter of the course. The project includes the preparation of a paper and a 20 minute oral presentation critically analyzing a current material-tissue or material-solution problem. Students will be expected to design improvements to materials and devices to overcome the problems identified in class with existing materials.<br/></p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Apply math, science &amp; engineering principles to the understanding of soft materials, surface chemistry, DLVO theory, protein adsorption kinetics, viscoelasticity, mass diffusion, and molecular (i.e., drug) delivery kinetics.<br/>
