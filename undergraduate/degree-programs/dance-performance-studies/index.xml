<h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Within the Department of Dance and Performance Studies curriculum, we understand performance to be a mode of critical inquiry and research, a means of a creative expression, and a vehicle for public engagement. We engage with dance on physical, intellectual and aesthetic levels. It is our hope that dancers not only grow as performers, but also as artists, thinkers, makers, viewers, and participants.</p>
<p>The practical focus of the major is on the performance and choreography of contemporary dance and dance theater. Of equal importance is the study of theater and dance theory, history, culture, and literature. Additional curriculum opportunities in sound and visual design, improvisation, technical theater and movement pedagogy complete the major.</p>
<p>The dance training and academic courses offered by our department are intense and geared toward the student who is interested in learning about dance and performance from multiple perspectives. As either a major or minor in Dance and Performance Studies, you will study with faculty known nationally and internationally for their scholarly research and their creative work. Our graduates have gone on to professional careers founding their own dance companies and dancing with artists such as Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham, Mark Morris, Joe Goode, Paul Taylor, Twyla Tharp, Levy Dance, Margaret Jenkins, Liz Roman, Lenora Lee, Janice Garrett, Robert Moses, Todd Eckert, Deep Waters Dance Theater, and countless others. Many students have gone on to graduate study in various fields and are currently teaching in universities across the country. Others have applied their training to diverse professions ranging from health care to education; nonprofit administration to business. </p>
<p>The opportunities in our department are many and varied. They include a student choreography performance at the end of each semester, an annual spring concert series where students perform in faculty and guest-artist choreographed repertory pieces, Dance/Choreography honors projects and invitations to a myriad of diverse and exciting lectures and performances. Additionally, students have access to world-renowned visiting guest artists through our close relationship with Cal Performances and extensive network in the field.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>For further information regarding the prerequisites for declaring the major, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors in the Department of Dance and Performance Studies with an overall GPA of 3.3 in the University may, with the approval of the department, apply for admission to the honors program. Students should apply through the undergraduate academic adviser no later than the 13th week of the spring semester of their junior year. If you wish to have your honors project culminate in a stage production, apply by February of the spring semester of your junior year. Students accepted into the honors program will take <span class="sc_courseinline">THEATER H195A</span>, an intensive, critical study of problems of dramatic literature, performance studies, acting, playwriting, directing, dance, choreography or design; and <span class="sc_courseinline">THEATER H195B</span>, where they will expand their work into either a stage production or a written thesis.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) offers a minor in Dance and Performance Studies. For further information regarding the minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>Confirm your intention to minor after enrolling in one course in the department. Transfer students can discuss transferability of coursework into the minor, as well as dance level placement, with Michael Mansfield, the undergraduate academic adviser. Since your minor will be from the Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here.</p>

<h3 style="margin-left:5pt">Transferring Units</h3>
<p style="margin-left:5.0pt">A maximum of 8 units of equivalent upper division coursework transfer into the major from education abroad programs or other 4-year colleges as electives upon departmental approval. All L&amp;S-approved units from other colleges transfer into your degree, but rarely into the major. We remind transfer students to bring a copy of previous transcripts/course descriptions to Michael Mansfield for evaluation. Because DPS majors require no additional electives for their major, this will probably not be an issue.</p>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies (TDPS) teaches performance as a mode of critical inquiry, creative expression and public engagement. Through performance training and research, the department creates liberal arts graduates with expanded analytical, technical and imaginative capacities. As a public institution, diversity and inclusion is a key part of teaching, art making, and public programming.</p>
<p>Undergraduate majors and minors are well prepared for the future, both as artists and engaged citizens of the world. At a time when scholars and practitioners across a variety of fields call for more cross-disciplinary intellectual collaboration and project-based learning in higher education, the department takes pride in its daily commitment to collaboration and to the kind of rigorously critical, team-based projects the department develops with its students, staff, and faculty both in the classroom and in its production season.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>

	<li>Collaborative skills.</li>
	<li>Foundational stagecraft and production skills and knowledge (e.g., design, craft and technology, stage management, and new media).</li>
	<li>Literacy in foundational dramatic texts and fundamental concepts of performance theory.</li>
	<li>Basic history of Euro-American dance practice, including issues of race, ethnicity, and multiculturalism in the performing arts.</li>
	<li>Basic modern/contemporary dance technique in the Western concert dance tradition.</li>
	<li>Understanding of the choreographic process and the tools necessary for this process.</li>
</ol>

Californians often think of our home state as a kind of “post-racial” space, one free of racial preference, discrimination, and prejudice, but to what extent is this true? This course explores two dynamics: (1) the racial structures of California historically and in the contemporary moment, and (2) how cultural systems of performance help shape social systems of race. We will consider the role a range of performance forms – theater, film, pageants,</span><span class="deschide"> political protests – have played in shaping California’s unique cultural and racial topography. We will use the histories of play productions and para-theatrical performances to interrogate conceptions of California as a “post-racial” state.</span><br/>

This is the second of two classes in stage lighting design and execution. In THEATER 175B you will study the design and execution of stage lighting from the visualization of the initial concept through the realization of that concept on stage. The course is divided into four segments. Review the foundational information about stage lighting. Develop a Production Proposal, for ROMEO &amp; JULIET, analyze the material and present a proposal</span><span class="deschide"> for a production of R&amp;J. Design a repertory light plot by drafting the plot with VectorWorks Spotlight, a CAD program for stage lighting.<br/>
Finally, in the Lighting Project, you will work with the BDP light plot in the Playhouse, creating light cues for music of your choice.<br/></span><br/>
