				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>Within the Department of Dance and Performance Studies curriculum, we understand performance to be a mode of critical inquiry and research, a means of a creative expression, and a vehicle for public engagement. We engage with dance on physical, intellectual and aesthetic levels. It is our hope that dancers not only grow as performers, but also as artists, thinkers, makers, viewers, and participants.</p>
<p>The practical focus of the major is on the performance and choreography of contemporary dance and dance theater. Of equal importance is the study of theater and dance theory, history, culture, and literature. Additional curriculum opportunities in sound and visual design, improvisation, technical theater and movement pedagogy complete the major.</p>
<p>The dance training and academic courses offered by our department are intense and geared toward the student who is interested in learning about dance and performance from multiple perspectives. As either a major or minor in Dance and Performance Studies, you will study with faculty known nationally and internationally for their scholarly research and their creative work. Our graduates have gone on to professional careers founding their own dance companies and dancing with artists such as Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham, Mark Morris, Joe Goode, Paul Taylor, Twyla Tharp, Levy Dance, Margaret Jenkins, Liz Roman, Lenora Lee, Janice Garrett, Robert Moses, Todd Eckert, Deep Waters Dance Theater, and countless others. Many students have gone on to graduate study in various fields and are currently teaching in universities across the country. Others have applied their training to diverse professions ranging from health care to education; nonprofit administration to business. </p>
<p>The opportunities in our department are many and varied. They include a student choreography performance at the end of each semester, an annual spring concert series where students perform in faculty and guest-artist choreographed repertory pieces, Dance/Choreography honors projects and invitations to a myriad of diverse and exciting lectures and performances. Additionally, students have access to world-renowned visiting guest artists through our close relationship with Cal Performances and extensive network in the field.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>For further information regarding the prerequisites for declaring the major, please see the Major Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Majors in the Department of Dance and Performance Studies with an overall GPA of 3.3 in the University may, with the approval of the department, apply for admission to the honors program. Students should apply through the undergraduate academic adviser no later than the 13th week of the spring semester of their junior year. If you wish to have your honors project culminate in a stage production, apply by February of the spring semester of your junior year. Students accepted into the honors program will take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=THEATER%20H195A" title="THEATER H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'THEATER H195A');">THEATER H195A</a></span>, an intensive, critical study of problems of dramatic literature, performance studies, acting, playwriting, directing, dance, choreography or design; and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=THEATER%20H195B" title="THEATER H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'THEATER H195B');">THEATER H195B</a></span>, where they will expand their work into either a stage production or a written thesis.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) offers a minor in Dance and Performance Studies. For further information regarding the minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page.</p>
<p>Confirm your intention to minor after enrolling in one course in the department. Transfer students can discuss transferability of coursework into the minor, as well as dance level placement, with Michael Mansfield, the undergraduate academic adviser. Since your minor will be from the Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies, it is likely you will do most of your minor coursework here.</p>

<h3 style="margin-left:5pt">Transferring Units</h3>
<p style="margin-left:5.0pt">A maximum of 8 units of equivalent upper division coursework transfer into the major from education abroad programs or other 4-year colleges as electives upon departmental approval. All L&amp;S-approved units from other colleges transfer into your degree, but rarely into the major. We remind transfer students to bring a copy of previous transcripts/course descriptions to Michael Mansfield for evaluation. Because DPS majors require no additional electives for their major, this will probably not be an issue.</p>

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Department of Theater, Dance and Performance Studies (TDPS) teaches performance as a mode of critical inquiry, creative expression and public engagement. Through performance training and research, the department creates liberal arts graduates with expanded analytical, technical and imaginative capacities. As a public institution, diversity and inclusion is a key part of teaching, art making, and public programming.</p>
<p>Undergraduate majors and minors are well prepared for the future, both as artists and engaged citizens of the world. At a time when scholars and practitioners across a variety of fields call for more cross-disciplinary intellectual collaboration and project-based learning in higher education, the department takes pride in its daily commitment to collaboration and to the kind of rigorously critical, team-based projects the department develops with its students, staff, and faculty both in the classroom and in its production season.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals for the Major</h3>
<p>By the end of their time in D&amp;PS, beyond TDPS goals, students should possess the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ability to synthesize a well-organized argument from textual or other evidence and to express it in formal, written form.</li>
	<li>Proficiency in research methods (i.e., utilization of public and private archives, libraries, electronic databases, oral histories; textual and performance analysis).</li>
	<li>Collaborative skills.</li>
	<li>Foundational stagecraft and production skills and knowledge (e.g., design, craft and technology, stage management, and new media).</li>
	<li>Literacy in foundational dramatic texts and fundamental concepts of performance theory.</li>
	<li>Basic history of Euro-American dance practice, including issues of race, ethnicity, and multiculturalism in the performing arts.</li>
	<li>Basic modern/contemporary dance technique in the Western concert dance tradition.</li>
	<li>Understanding of the choreographic process and the tools necessary for this process.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>Through upper division course work, electives, and capstone experiences students should also possess advanced training in at least one of the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choreography.</li>
	<li>Advanced Dance Technique.</li>
	<li>History &amp; Theory of Dance.</li>

This is a project-based class in collaborative innovation where students experience group creativity and team-based design by using techniques from across the disciplines of business, theatre, design, and art practice. They will leverage problem framing and solving techniques derived from critical thinking, systems thinking, and creative problem solving (popularly known today as design thinking). The course is grounded in a brief weekly lecture</span><span class="deschide"> that sets out the theoretical, historical, and cultural contexts for particular innovation practices, but the majority of the class involves hands-on studio-based learning guided by an interdisciplinary team of teachers leading small group collaborative projects.<br/>

Californians often think of our home state as a kind of “post-racial” space, one free of racial preference, discrimination, and prejudice, but to what extent is this true?

We will use the histories of play productions and para-theatrical performances to interrogate conceptions of California as a “post-racial” state.</span><br/>
