<h3>M.E.T. at a Glance: One program, two Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees</h3>
<p>The Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and Business Administration simultaneous degree is part of the Management, Entrepreneurship, &amp; Technology Program. The M.E.T. Program aims to educate leaders with a seamless understanding of technology innovation, from idea to real-world impact.</p>
<p>M.E.T. students earn two Bachelor of Science degrees in one program that combines the best of the top-ranked College of Engineering and Haas School of Business. The integrated curriculum is completed in four years. Internships, career coaching, and other enrichment activities provide ample opportunity for hands-on experience with innovation and entrepreneurship. Each M.E.T. cohort is small, allowing for close mentoring and a tight-knit community.</p>
<h3>Admission to the M.E.T. Program</h3>
<p>The M.E.T. Program seeks inquisitive, self-motivated students with a passion for finding and solving big problems. It is highly competitive and is only open to freshmen during the UC application period. </p>

<p><a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/entry-level-writing-requirement/">Entry Level Writing</a></p>
<p>All students who enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by fulfilling the Entry Level Writing Requirement. Fulfillment of this requirement is also a prerequisite to enrollment in all reading and composition courses at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-history-institutions-requirement/">American History and American Institutions</a></p>
<p>The American History and Institutions requirements are based on the principle that a US resident who graduates from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Campus Requirement</strong></p>
<p><a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/american-cultures-requirement/">American Cultures</a></p>
<p>American Cultures (AC) is the one requirement that all undergraduate students at UC Berkeley need to take and pass in order to graduate. The requirement offers an exciting intellectual environment centered on the study of race, ethnicity, and culture of the United States. AC courses offer students opportunities to be part of research-led, highly accomplished teaching environments, grappling with the complexity of American culture.</p>
<p><strong>M.E.T. Program Requirements</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading and Composition</strong></p>
<p>Two Reading and Composition (R&amp;C) courses must be taken for a letter grade (C- or better required), and must be completed by no later than the end of the sophomore year (4th semester of enrollment). The first half of R&amp;C, the “A” course, must be completed by the end of the freshman year; the second half of R&amp;C, the “B “course, by no later than the end of the sophomore year or a student's registration will be blocked. View a <a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/engineering/reading-composition-requirement/">detailed list of courses </a>that fulfill Reading and Composition requirements. </p>
<p><strong>Breadth Requirement</strong></p>
<p>The undergraduate breadth requirement provides Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and context that prepare Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</p>
<p>Students in the M.E.T. Program must successfully complete six breadth courses, one in each of the following categories:</p>
<p><a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/arts-literature/">Arts and Literature</a></p>
<p><a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/haas-business/historical-studies/">Historical Studies</a></p>

Energy is one of the main drivers of civilization. Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use. Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed</span><span class="deschide"> world. On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach? Can we achieve both simultaneously? If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.</span><br/>

<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives  Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> C8R also includes quantitative reasoning concepts that aren’t covered in Data 8. These include certain topics in: principles of data visualization; simulation of random processes; and understanding numerical functions through their graphs. This will help prepare students for computational and quantitative courses other than Data 8.<br/>C8R takes advantage of the complementarity of computing and quantitative reasoning to enliven abstract ideas and build students’ confidence in their ability to solve real problems with quantitative tools. Students learn computer science concepts and immediately apply them to plot functions, visualize data, and simulate random events.<br/>
<br/>Foundations of Data Science (CS/Info/Stat C8, a.k.a. Data 8) is an increasingly popular class for entering students at Berkeley. Data 8 builds students’ computing skills in the first month of the semester, and students rely on these skills as the course progresses. For some students, particularly those with little prior exposure to computing, developing these skills benefits from further time and practice. C8R is a rapid introduction to Python programming, visualization, and data analysis, which will prepare students for success in Data 8.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will be able to perform basic computations in Python, including working with tabular data.<br/>
Students will be able to understand basic probabilistic simulations.<br/>
Students will be able to understand the syntactic structure of Python code.<br/>
Students will be able to use good practices in Python programming.<br/>
Students will be able to use visualizations to understand univariate data and to identify associations or causal relationships in bivariate data.</p></div>
