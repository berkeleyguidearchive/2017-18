				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Music grants a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Music and also a minor in Music. The department is dedicated to a liberal education in the arts and humanities and thus involves students in all aspects of the study of music-theoretical and creative studies, historical and cultural studies, music and technology, and performance. The curriculum is responsive to the interests of a diverse student body, and the program offers a broad and flexible program.</p>
<p>The major may serve as preprofessional training for the student seeking a career in music or provide a lasting source of enrichment for the student with other career goals. Prospective majors are asked to demonstrate a minimum standard of musical literacy in a placement test. Since the program is offered by a department of music rather than a school of music, a performance audition is not required to declare the major.</p>
<p>There are a large number of double majors in the department representing fields such as molecular and cell biology, rhetoric, physics, theater, dance, and performance studies, political economy of industrial societies, English, and business administration, just to name a few.</p>
<h3>Course of Study Overview</h3>
<p>Lower division studies are intended to provide grounding in the skills of musicianship and harmony and a broad background in the literature and practices of European and a variety of other music. Upper division students may choose from an extensive selection of elective courses to create an individual course of study according to their own interests. The department offers an honors program in which a major in the senior year may develop a special honors project working with a faculty adviser in any area of music studies.</p>
<p>Students without keyboard proficiency are strongly urged to enroll in two semesters of <span class="sc_courseinline">Elementary Piano (<a href="/search/?P=MUSIC%20405" title="MUSIC 405" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MUSIC 405');">MUSIC 405</a>)</span> in their first semesters in the major program.</p>
<h3>Course Placement Procedure</h3>
<p><span>Students who plan to major in music or wish to take music major classes must complete the Music Placement Procedure before beginning music major classes. Students may pre-enroll in classes before the </span>Musicianship Placement Exam<span> and make adjustments to their schedule during the add/drop period if necessary. For detailed information regarding the placement tests, please see the </span><a href="http://music.berkeley.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-degree-program/placement-procedure-for-music-major-courses/">Placement Procedure</a><span> page on the department's website.</span></p>

		<li>Performance</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>An Undergraduate Orientation is held once before the beginning of each semester.The orientation reviews important information such as placement exams, major requirements, program planning, major resources, and student life. It is imperative that prospective music majors make every possible effort to attend.</p>
<p>Students should submit the Intent to Declare the Music Major form to the Undergraduate Advisor and create a program plan as soon as possible after placement.</p>
<h3><span>Honors Program</span></h3>
<p>The Department of Music offers an individualized program leading to the BA degree with honors. Students with a grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 overall and 3.5 in the major may apply to enroll in the honors program in the last two semesters of their undergraduate study. Under course <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=MUSIC%20H195" title="MUSIC H195" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'MUSIC H195');">MUSIC H195</a></span>, students undertake a special project exceeding the scope of regular coursework for one or two semesters.

				<a name="minorrequirementstext"></a><h2>Minor Requirements</h2><p>Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program. These programs have set requirements and are noted officially on the transcript in the memoranda section, but they are not noted on diplomas.</p>
<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
	<li>All courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements below must be taken for graded credit.</li>
	<li>A minimum of three of the upper division courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be completed at UC Berkeley.</li>
	<li>A minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.</li>
	<li>Courses used to fulfill the minor requirements may be applied toward the Seven-Course Breadth requirement, for Letters &amp; Science students.</li>
	<li>No more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student's major and minor programs.</li>
	<li>All minor requirements must be completed prior to the last day of finals during the semester in which the student plans to graduate. If students cannot finish all courses required for the minor by that time, they should see a College of Letters &amp; Science adviser.</li>

Students are exposed to terminology and modes of engagement with the aim of inspiring new paradigms of listening (e.g., listening to silence, noise, space, and timbre). Composers and musicians of today continue to explore new ways of defining and organizing sounds into music.</span><span class="deschide"> The course focuses on the most adventurous music of our time, but the concepts learned can be applied to any style of music. The course is designed to enrich and deepen the students' musical abilities through direct involvement with musical materials.

This course will explore the question of whether music has meaning, and if so, what kind. Can music represent, say, birdsong, or the sea, or merely imitate? If music expresses emotions, then whose--those of the listener? The composer? The performer? We will consider parallels and contrasts between linguistic and musical meaning, theories of how music can be expressive, and the question of whether music can convey political meaning.</span><br />

This course will explore the question of whether music has meaning, and if so, what kind. Can music represent, say, birdsong, or the sea, or merely imitate? If music expresses emotions, then whose--those of the listener? The composer? The performer? We will consider parallels and contrasts between linguistic and musical meaning, theories of how music can be expressive, and the question of whether music can convey political meaning.</span><br />

This course focuses on selected &quot;world musics&quot; to examine how, through their soundings, they make audible their entanglements with particular locales, times, and spaces. In focusing on their soundings, we will examine not only the music technologies they use, but also the diasporic connections they establish. Issues of power relations will be central to our exploration of how these musics circulate and what values (social, economic, and aesthetic)</span><span class="deschide"> they have acquired on specific markets. In so doing, we will situate these musics in relation to colonial legacies, the politics of labeling, globalization, and music industries.</span><br />

This course explores the intersections between aesthetic practice and social change. Students will investigate—in both theory and practice—the capacity of art making to cultivate transformation of themselves, their relationships, their practices, their institutions, and the larger economic and socio-political structures in which they function, locally and globally. Focusing on historical and contemporary artists and political issues, we ask:</span><span class="deschide"> 1) How is art impacted by social change? 2) How has art been used toward social change? and 3) How can we, as course participants, use art to bring about social change?</span><br />

As hip-hop becomes an increasingly prominent force in U.S. popular culture, it remains a paradoxical art form. As a musical and political tool, it challenges, complicates, and transforms the historical formations of race even as it gives expressive shape to the material realities of racial inequity. This course traces the social, cultural, and musical history of hip-hop in the U.S. through an excavation of seven urban</span><span class="deschide"> centers: New York, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit. Our investigations will reveal the many alliances that have contributed to the innovation, production, and consumption of hip-hop across identity assemblages formed at the intersections of gender, race, sexuality, and ethnicity.</span><br />
