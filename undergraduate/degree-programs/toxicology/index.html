<p>The Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology (NST) offers a minor in Toxicology. The coursework for the minor addresses topics in the basic principles of toxicology and molecular toxicology as well as computational toxicology, pharmacology, and pesticide chemistry. The minor works best for students already pursuing a bioscience degree as a background in chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, and biochemistry is necessary to be prepared for upper division work in this field.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the CNR Office of Instruction and Student Affairs in 260 Mulford Hall.  </p>
