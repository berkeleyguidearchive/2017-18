				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BS)</h3>
<p>The College of Natural Resources and the College of Letters &amp; Science jointly offer the undergraduate major in Environmental Economics and Policy (EEP). This major offers an opportunity to explore aspects of economic and political institutions that affect the development and management of natural resources and the environment. The program takes a problem-solving approach to issues involving renewable and fixed natural resources, and it is based on a foundation in microeconomic theory and the economics of resources and the environment. The environmental economics and policy program is offered by the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics.</p>
<p>This major leads to a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree (for students in the College of Natural Resources) or a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree (for students in the College of Letters &amp; Science).</p>
<p>Students who graduate with a degree in environmental economics and policy go on to a variety of jobs or graduate programs.</p>
<h3>Admission to the Major</h3>
<p>Freshman students may apply directly to the major or may select the College of Natural Resource's undeclared option, and declare the major by the end of their fourth semester. For further information regarding how to declare the major after admission, including information on a change of major of change of college, please see the <a href=" https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook">College of Natural Resources Undergraduate Student Handbook</a><a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/handbook">.</a></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students with a GPA of 3.6 or higher may enroll in the College of Natural Resources honors program (H196) once they have reached upper division standing. To fulfill the program requirements, students design, conduct, and report on an individual research project, working with a faculty sponsor. For further information about registration for the honors symposium or the honors requirements, please see the <a href="http://nature.berkeley.edu/site/honors_program.php">College of Natural Resources website</a>.</p>
<h3>Minor Program</h3>
<p>The minor program offers interested students an opportunity to explore aspects of economic and political institutions that affect the development and management of natural resources and the environment. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please contact the department.</p><p class="btn-deptsite"><a href="http://are.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Visit Department Website</a></p>

Students admitted as transfer students must graduate within 4 fall/spring semesters at UC Berkeley. Students who go on EAP and UCDC can petition for additional semesters. Summer session, UC Extension and non-UC study abroad programs do not count towards this semester limit. Students approved for double majors or  simultaneous degrees in two colleges may be granted an additional semester. CNR does not limit the number of total units a student can accrue.</p> <h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3> <p>After reaching senior status (90 semester units earned), students must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in at least two semesters in residence at the College of Natural Resources. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least four passed units.

This course is a self-contained introduction to the economics of climate change. Climate change is caused by a large variety of economic activities, and many of its impacts will have economic consequences. Economists have studied climate change for more than two decades, and economic arguments are often powerful in policy decisions. The course will familiarize students with these arguments</span><span class="deschide"> and equip them with the tools to participate in discussions of climate change policy through an economic lens.</span><br/>
 <a href="" class="btn-readmore"><span>Climate Change Economics:</span> Read More [+]</a></p>
<div id="800" class="coursedetails" aria-expanded="false">
<div class="course-section"><p class="course-heading"><strong>Objectives  Outcomes</strong></p><p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> The course will start with a brief review of the science of climate change, discuss scenarios of economic growth and the greenhouse gas emissions caused by economic activities and investigate various emission reduction opportunities and their economic costs. A significant amount of time will be spent on studying the impacts of climate change, their economic evaluation and how adaptation can lower the costs of climate damages.<br/>
<br/>We will then study various theoretical frameworks economists have developed that answer the question how estimates about the costs and benefits of climate policy can be combined to find “good” climate policies. We then study three more specialized topics that turn out to be of great importance when analyzing climate change policy: first, how do we compare costs and benefits of generations that live many centuries apart? Second, how do we design climate policy when our projections of both the costs and the benefits of climate policy are highly uncertain? And third, how can equity considerations be accounted for in an economic assessment of climate change policy? The course will close with a look at international cooperation on climate policy and why it has been so difficult to agree on effective treatises that implement climate change policy.</p><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Students will also have gained insight into the practical aspects of modeling the economics of climate change by building a simple integrated assessment model in Excel. They will be able to use that model to do simple analysis of climate change policy themselves.<br/>
Students will be familiar with the tools economists use to analyze climate change policy. They will have studied empirical estimates of the costs and benefits of climate policy and have an understanding of the analytical issues that drive research on the economics of climate change.</p></div>
