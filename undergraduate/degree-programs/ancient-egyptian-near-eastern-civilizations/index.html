				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Minor</h3>
<p>The Department of Near Eastern Studies offers a minor in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Civilizations. For information regarding the department's major programs, please see the program pages for <a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/degree-programs/ancient-egyptian-near-eastern-art-archaeology/">Ancient Egyptian Near Eastern Art and Archaeology</a>, <a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/degree-programs/near-eastern-languages-literatures/">Near Eastern Languages and Literatures</a>, and <a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/degree-programs/near-eastern-civilizations/">Near Eastern Civilizations</a> in this Guide. </p>
<p>Students may pursue the major in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Art and Archaeology and a minor in one of the department's language programs, even though both are administered by the Department of Near Eastern Studies; students may <em>not </em>pursue a major in one of the Near Eastern Studies languages and a minor in another. Students may pursue the major in Near Eastern Languages and Literatures and a minor in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Civilizations. </p>
<h3>Declaring the Minor</h3>
<p>For students who are majors in other subjects, but who have a strong interest in one of the modern languages or ancient history of the Near East, the department offers programs leading to a minor in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Civilizations, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, and Turkish. For information regarding how to declare the minor, please see the <a href="http://cmes.berkeley.edu/degree-programs/the-minor-in-middle-eastern-studies/">department's website</a>.</p>
