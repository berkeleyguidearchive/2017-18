				<a name="abouttheprogramtext"></a><h2>About the Program</h2><h3>Bachelor of Arts (BA)</h3>
<p>The Department of Economics is home to over 1200 undergraduate students. Economics majors can enroll in a broad array of economics courses, ranging from economic history to advanced macroeconomics. Students are encouraged to study abroad, participate in research, and take advantage of the many opportunities Berkeley has to offer.</p>
<h3>Declaring the Major</h3>
<p>As an impacted major with a highly competitive admissions process, the economics major is capped. Students who want to apply to the economics major must have completed or be currently enrolled in all the major prerequisites. After fall 2004, students admitted to Berkeley as freshmen must apply by their fifth semester of post-high school coursework unless they have fewer than 80 total units. This total includes coursework in progress but excludes high school enrichment units, e.g., Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or other college units earned prior to high school graduation. Transfer students admitted to Berkeley in fall 2006 and later are required to enroll in missing prerequisites and apply to the major during their first semester at Berkeley. The unit cap does not apply to transfer students.</p>
<p>For more information, please visit the department's <a href="https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/undergrad/prospective">website.</a></p>
<h3>Honors Program</h3>
<p>Students interested in graduating with honors in economics should consult with a faculty adviser no later than the first semester of their senior year. The department recommends a student for graduation with honors based on evidence of superior performance provided by a thesis written in the senior year and the student's course grade record overall and in the major. The minimum major grade point average (GPA) requirement is 3.5 in upper division economics courses and 3.3 GPA overall. The senior thesis may be an extension of a seminar paper prepared under the continued guidance of a faculty member through enrollment in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%20H195A" title="ECON H195A" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON H195A');">ECON H195A</a></span>/<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ECON%20H195B" title="ECON H195B" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ECON H195B');">ECON H195B</a></span>.</p>

While there are advantages to pursuing a three-year degree plan such as reducing financial burdens, they are not for everyone and do involve sacrifices; especially with respect to participating in co-curricular activities, depth of study,  and summer internships, which typically lead to jobs upon graduation.

				<a name="studentlearninggoalstext"></a><h2>Student Learning Goals</h2><h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Economics is the study of how people make choices under conditions of scarcity and the results of those choices for society. Limited resources make tradeoffs necessary for consumers, businesses, and nations. Microeconomics studies how consumers make choices in using their time and spending their income and how businesses make choices in producing and selling goods and services. Macroeconomics studies the determination of national income and how it deviates from its potential (full employment) over the business cycle. The important outcomes for the national economy are income and how it is distributed, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and how well financial markets and international trade are functioning. Economics is important in studying the impact of government policies, ranging from regulatory activities in individual markets to general measures for stabilizing and steering the economy at large. The effect of alternative economic policies on the welfare of the population is a core concern in economics. Undergraduates should have the following knowledge and skills when they graduate with an economics major from UC Berkeley. The Department of Economics wants their majors to have knowledge of economics principles with the skills to apply this knowledge in the following ways.</p>

This course provides an introduction to the analysis of economic inequalities and the interplay between inequality and economic growth. It focuses on three sets of core questions: 1) How does inequality evolve over the path of development? 2) What are the theories that can explain the degree of economic inequalities and its dynamic? 3) How do policies affect inequalities, and what types of policies</span><span class="deschide"> can foster equitable growth? The course addresses these issues from a global and historical perspective: it comprehensively deals with the United States today, but also with inequality in China, India, Latin America, and Europe, as far back as 1700.</span><br/>

This is a 4-unit advanced undergraduate course designed for undergraduates in Economics, Statistics, Mathematics, and Industrial Engineering/Operations Research who are interested in financial economics and finance. This course will stress the link between financial economics and equilibrium theory. Less attention will be devoted to purely financial topics such as the valuation of derivatives. This course is intended as the segue between a first</span><span class="deschide"> course in financial economics (at the undergraduate level) and graduate-level courses in financial economics and finance.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to introduce students to the full range of topics typically covered by a financial economics and/or discrete time asset pricing course at the doctoral level.</span><br/>
