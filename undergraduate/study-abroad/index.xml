<h3>Study Abroad Opportunities</h3>
<p>A tenet of a successful Berkeley undergraduate education is developing global awareness, and one of the best ways to gain an appreciation is to participate in a study abroad program. Before you engage in any international program you should check with your college or major adviser to make sure your coursework will transfer to Berkeley and fulfill requirements.</p>
