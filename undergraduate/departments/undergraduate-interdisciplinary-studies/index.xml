<h2><span>Overview</span></h2>
<p>Undergraduate Studies, in the College of Letters and Science, serves students at every stage of their undergraduate careers, from the initial years of intellectual exploration through the process of finding and pursuing an in-depth academic focus. Undergraduate Studies is a center for innovations in undergraduate education that extend beyond traditional departmental boundaries. Our major and minor programs attract undergraduates who wish to explore the most intellectually engaging and promising interdisciplinary fields under the direction of scholars who are pioneers in charting these new areas and methods of inquiry.</p>
<p>Undergraduate Studies has been, and continues to be, an incubator for new ideas, including experimental programs and courses, as well as curricula designed to promote the ideals of a liberal arts education. We are especially dedicated to creating programs such as the Freshman and Sophomore Seminar Program and the undergraduate research programs that nurture productive intellectual relationships between faculty members and students.</p>
<p>Finally, given the array of academic opportunities available for students in the College of Letters and Science, the Office of Undergraduate Advising (housed in Undergraduate Studies) helps students make the most out of their time at Berkeley by guiding them as they choose among their academic options.</p>
<p>Undergraduate Studies is composed of the following three subunits: Academic Enrichment Programs, Interdisciplinary Major and Minor Programs, and Undergraduate Advising.</p>
<h3>Academic Enrichment Programs</h3>
<p><a href="http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/">Big Ideas Courses</a>, launched in 2012, bring together two or more faculty members from different disciplines to co-teach innovative breadth courses. Big Ideas Courses take up key intellectual and societal challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by the perspective or methodology of one discipline alone. For more information, call 510.642.8378 or visit the <a href="http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/">website</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://calteach.berkeley.edu/">Cal Teach</a><strong> </strong>is a program for undergraduate science, math, and engineering majors interested in exploring a career in education. Through our courses, students learn conceptual teaching skills and practice these methods in local K-12 classrooms. Cal Teach offers the minor in Science and Math Education, as well as a unique opportunity for students to complete both a degree and a California teaching credential as an undergraduate.</p>
<p><a href="http://data.berkeley.edu/">Data Science</a>: <span class="s1">Berkeley’s Data Science education program provides a foundation for students in all fields to engage capably and critically with data and creates pathways to advanced-level work.  The program starts from one simple fact: Faculty across Berkeley see a critical need to prepare our students for a data-rich world. The program begins at the introductory level, with a pathbreaking foundational course (<a href="http://data8.org/"><span class="s2">Foundations of Data Science, or Data 8</span></a>) that combines instruction in core computational and statistics concepts while enabling students to work hands-on with real data in a range of fields. It is designed to be accessible to undergraduates of any intended major, and does not require prior experience in the field. A set of innovative connector courses enable students to apply core skills from the foundational course to real-world issues that relate to students’ areas of interest. The Data Science program is now adding new courses that take Foundations of Data Science as a prerequisite, and developing pathways toward major and minor programs of study.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://ls.berkeley.edu/?q=undergraduate/special-courses-enrichment-opportunities/ls5">Entrepreneurship Courses</a> are organized in conjunction with the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation; <span class="sc_courseinline">L &amp; S 5</span> is designed for freshmen and sophomores who wish to learn about entrepreneurship and its role in bringing new ideas to market. At the upper division, we offer L&amp;S 105: Arts Entrepreneurship, for students in arts-related majors and others interested in careers in this arena.</p>
<p><a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/">Freshman and Sophomore Seminars</a> arose from the conviction that early intellectual contact with faculty members would greatly enhance the undergraduate experience at Berkeley. Professors from nearly every campus department join together each semester to offer an impressive array of seminars. The courses numbered 24 bear one unit of credit; they are limited to 15 students, and freshmen are given priority for enrollment. The courses numbered 84 bear one or two units of credit; they are limited to 15 sophomores. The courses numbered 39A-39Z are limited to 25 freshmen and sophomores.</p>
<p>Seminars, which emphasize interaction and discussion, provide a counterpoint to the learning experience in Berkeley's large lecture halls. These seminars also offer lower division students an unprecedented opportunity to explore a wide range of majors and even fields of study usually reserved for graduate students. As you browse through this Guide<em>,</em> you will find lower division seminars sponsored by Letters and Science departments, as well as by the professional schools and colleges. Descriptions of all the seminars scheduled for the upcoming semester can be found ion the program's website, which also contains other useful information and features for undergraduates. For additional information regarding the Freshman and Sophomore Seminars, contact the program office at 231 Evans Hall, 510-642-8378.</p>
<p><a href="http://impressioncourses.berkeley.edu">Impression Courses</a><a href="http://impressioncourses.berkeley.edu"> </a>are for new freshmen who seek a deeper connection with their new classmates—and classes. Students selected for the Impression Courses take one popular breadth course together and live on the same floor in the residence halls. This arrangement provides new students with a community of other engaged students with whom to discuss course content and study for exams. Other benefits include guaranteed housing and a guaranteed seat in a high-demand course. For details call 510-642-8378 or visit the <a href="http://impressioncourses.berkeley.edu">website</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">Letters and Science Discovery Courses</a> are exemplary breadth courses, designed to engage and broaden the minds of non-experts. Taught by some of the most distinguished faculty members on campus, the L&amp;S Discovery Courses are guaranteed to deliver a high-quality educational experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://onthesamepage.berkeley.edu">On the Same Page</a><strong> </strong>is a campuswide book-in-common program, designed to welcome new freshmen and transfer students into the intellectual dialogue that characterizes the Berkeley campus. Each year all of the faculty and all new students receive a book (or film or other study object) that provides the focus for discussions, courses, events, and activities in the fall term. For more information, call 510-642-8378 or visit the <a href="http://onthesamepage.berkeley.edu">website.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://scholarships.berkeley.edu/">Scholarship Connection</a> administers the application process for over a dozen prestigious external scholarships (such as the Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, and Gates scholarships) and offers a clearinghouse for information on 500+ other external scholarships. For more information, visit us online at <a href="http://scholarships.berkeley.edu/">Scholarship Connection</a> or contact Scholarship Connection at 2410 Dwinelle Hall, <a href="mailto:ourscholarships@berkeley.edu">ourscholarships@berkeley.edu</a>, or 510-643-6929.</p>

With this course, you will be able to add a new dimension to your internship experience: a reflection on global citizenship. You will be challenged to use your internship experience as an opportunity to critically explore cultural differences, modes of conduct and values. A series of audio-visual lectures, practical exercises, writing assignments, projects, and online group discussions will</span><span class="deschide"> stimulate you to leave the comfort zone of what you are familiar with and to explore alternative views on right and wrong, good and bad and the beautiful and the ugly. The course will also encourage you to interact with locals and to engage with the city/region/country where you live during your internship.<br/></span><br/>

As history has shown, there is no bully pulpit in the world like the American presidency. Whether it was Roosevelt declaring war on the Japanese or Regan declaring war on government bureaucracy, they, like all presidents, understood the power of their words to make history and to change it. This course will study the history of the presidency through their speeches. We will read and analyze remarks delivered from the podium in economic booms and busts,</span><span class="deschide"> in times of social unrest, and even in moments of humor. By reading others and drafting our own, we will also learn the elements of an effective speech and how to craft and deliver one. A few former and current presidential speechwriters will be featured as guests throughout the semester. Course requirements include the 750-word op-ed, preparation and delivery of a 10-minute speech, writing a mid-term paper based on course materials and sitting for a final exam.</span><br/>

Few things have characterized mass culture in the 20th century more consistently and thoroughly than sports. We will look at the phenomenon ubiquitous to all advanced industrial societies where disorganized contests, competitions, and games mutated into what we have come to know as modern team sports. We will see how this transformation was virtually identical in every industrial society and should thus be seen as a fine gauge of modernity.</span><br/>

World leaders at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Copenhagen this past December announced that they reached &quot;a meaningful agreement&quot; that will lead to a global treaty to address climate change. Many observers see the politics of the Copenhagen Accord as a glimpse into the new world order in which international diplomatic power will increasingly be shared by the United States (U.S.) and emerging powers, such as China.</span><span class="deschide"> Climate change policy also offers a lens through which the U.S. domestic environmental policymaking process can be viewed and its evolution better understood. This course will examine the dynamics of global environmental treaty-making after first studying the development of U.S. environmental protection efforts. Students will then analyze the international and domestic efforts that led up to the Copenhagen Accord and assess what is needed and likely to result from the next UNFCCC meeting to be held in Mexico City in 2010.</span><br/>

This course explores museums as dynamic sites of intellectual and cultural debate, and as institutions vested with the authority to define aesthetics, history, heritage, and even citizenship. Now more than ever, as the process of globalization raises questions about the fluidity, preservation, and &quot;authenticity&quot; of culture, museums of all kinds are attracting great interest both as places to visit and as a subject of critical analysis in their</span><span class="deschide"> own right. As places defined by the collection, display, and interpretation of objects, museums are bound up in questions of permanence and transience, difference and identity, equity and privilege--issues that lie at the heart of what is termed the &quot;new museology.&quot; But as institutional repositories of community memory or indigenous knowledge, they are also bound up in questions of representation, access and ownership--issues that move the debate over museum collections squarely into the politics of local, state, and national control over heritage. If ownership and control are the new realities of international heritage policy (and law), museums have quickly emerged as important sites on which and through which these claims are being made.</span><br/>
