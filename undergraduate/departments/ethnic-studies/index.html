<h2><span>Overview</span></h2>




<p>The Department of Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley offers undergraduate majors and minors in Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies, Chicano Studies, Ethnic Studies, and Native American Studies. Our faculty members represent a range of disciplinary backgrounds from the humanities and social sciences. Most focus on one ethnoracial group or geographic area, but many have comparative foci, and all members of the faculty seek to provide collectively a comparative framework for understanding both the specificities and the differences among the situations of racially-marginalized groups in the U.S. and beyond.</p>




<p>Several of our faculty members also emphasize the intersections of race with gender, sexuality, and class. All of our faculty members are committed to fostering an interdisciplinary method that expands the kinds of primary sources, as well as the kinds of research questions, one would work with in any of the traditional disciplines. Our students regularly work at nuanced readings of cultural texts (broadly understood to include literature, art, music, and other forms of expression) and at the same time seek to situate those texts —and their readings — in the context of struggles over power and structural inequality.</p>




<p>For information regarding the <a href="/2017-18/graduate/degree-programs/ethnic-studies/">PhD program in Ethnic Studies</a>, see the <a href="/2017-18/graduate/schools-departments-graduate-groups/ethnic-studies/">Ethnic Studies Graduate Group information in this Guide</a>.</p>

The course will spend considerable time on the African American, Indo-Pakistani, and Arab American Muslim communities since they constitute the largest groupings. It also</span><span class="deschide"> examines in depth the emergence of national, regional, and local Muslim institutions, patterns of development pursued by a number of them, and levels of cooperation or antagonism. The course seeks an examination of gender relations and dynamics across the various Muslim groupings, and the internal and external factors that contribute to real and imagined crisis. The course seeks to conduct and document the growth and expansion of mosques, schools, and community centers in the greater Bay Area. Finally, no class on Islam in America would be complete without a critical examination of the impacts of 9/11 on Muslim communities, the erosion of civil rights, and the ongoing war on terrorism.</span><br/>

Taking a broad interdisciplinary approach, this course embraces the longue duree of critical prison studies, questioning the shadows of normality that cloak mass incarceration both across the globe and, more particularly, in the contemporary United States. This course thus explores a series of visceral, unsettling juxtapositions: &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;slavery&quot;; &quot;citizenship&quot; and &quot;subjugation&quot;; &quot;marginalization&quot; and &quot;inclusion&quot;</span><span class="deschide">, in each case explicating the ways that story making, political demagoguery, and racial, class, and sexual inequalities have wrought an untenable social condition.</span><br/>

This course will critically examine the complex relationship between race, rights, and citizenship. We will closely review contemporary laws on immigration, national security, voting rights, language access and affirmative action, and their associated social contexts and legal conflicts around racial profiling, education access, and citizenship rights. Citizenship rights are</span><span class="deschide"> understood broadly in this class from “alienage” (the hierarchical demarcation of non-citizen versus citizen) to the right to marriage. A primary focus of this course is to understand how despite discrimination, outsiders have gained access to “insider” rights and in the process have naturalized what previously was considered out of the norm.<br/></span><br/>
