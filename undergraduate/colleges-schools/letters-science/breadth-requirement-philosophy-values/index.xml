<p><strong>Beginning fall 2015, breadth courses must be at least three units in value.</strong></p>
<p>The following courses satisfy the Philosophy and Values area of the Seven Course Breadth requirement. No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the Seven Course Breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a>Â are exempt). Courses numbered 84, 97, 98, 99, and 190 and above do not receive breadth credit. In cases where any of the courses listed below are offered online (indicated by a &quot;W&quot; prefix), that course will be treated in the same way as its regular semester counterpart and will satisfy this breadth area.</p>
<p>Students who have successfully completed 2 unit breadth prior to fall 2015 will be accepted for graduation requirements.</p>
