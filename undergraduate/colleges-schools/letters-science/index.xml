<h3>Quantitative Reasoning</h3>
<p>The Quantitative Reasoning requirement is designed to ensure that students graduate with basic understanding and competency in math, statistics, or computer science. The requirement may be satisfied by exam or by taking an approved course. <a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/quantitative-reasoning-requirement/" target="_blank">Learn more</a>. </p>
<h3>Foreign Language </h3>
<p>The Foreign Language requirement may be satisfied by demonstrating proficiency in reading comprehension, writing, and conversation in a foreign language equivalent to the second semester college level, either by passing an exam or by completing approved course work. <a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/foreign-language-requirement/">Learn more</a>. </p>
<h3>Reading and Composition </h3>
<p>In order to provide a solid foundation in reading, writing, and critical thinking, the College requires two semesters in sequence of lower division work in composition. Students must complete the reading and composition requirement by the end of their fourth semester. <a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/reading-composition-requirement/" target="_blank">Learn more</a> and <a href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/reading-composition-requirement#RC">review courses</a>. </p>

<p>For units to be considered in &quot;residence,&quot; students must be registered in courses on the Berkeley campus as a student in the College of Letters and Science. Most students automatically fulfill the residence requirement by attending classes here for four years. In general, there is no need to be concerned about this requirement, unless students go abroad for a semester or year or want to take courses at another institution or through University Extension during their senior year. In these cases, students should make an appointment to meet a College Adviser to determine how they can meet the Senior Residence Requirement.</p>
<p>Note: Courses taken through UC Extension do not count toward residence.</p>
<h3>Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>After becoming a senior (with 90 semester units earned toward the B.A. degree), students must complete at least 24 of the remaining 30 units in residence in at least two semesters. To count as residence, a semester must consist of at least 6 passed units. Intercampus Visitor, EAP, and UC Berkeley-Washington Program (UCDC) units are excluded.</p>
<p>Students may use a Berkeley summer session to satisfy one semester of the Senior Residence Requirement, provided that they successfully complete 6 units of course work in the Summer Session and that they have been enrolled previously in the College.</p>
<h3>Modified Senior Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Participants in the UC Education Abroad Program (EAP) or the UC Berkeley-Washington Program (UCDC) may meet a Modified Senior Residence Requirement by completing 24 (excluding EAP) of their final 60 semester units in residence. At least 12 of these 24 units must be completed after the completion of 90 units.</p>
<h3>Upper Division Residence Requirement</h3>
<p>Students must complete in residence a minimum of 18 units of upper division courses (excluding EAP units), 12 of which must satisfy the requirements for their major.</p>
<h3>Residence in the Major Requirement</h3>
<p>Of the 18 upper division units required for College Residence, 12 must be earned in courses that satisfy requirements for the major.</p>

<breadthrequirementstext>
<![CDATA[
<p><span>The undergraduate breadth requirements provide Berkeley students with a rich and varied educational experience outside of their major program. As the foundation of a liberal arts education, breadth courses give students a view into the intellectual life of the University while introducing them to a multitude of perspectives and approaches to research and scholarship. Engaging students in new disciplines and with peers from other majors, the breadth experience strengthens interdisciplinary connections and provides context that prepares Berkeley graduates to understand and solve the complex issues of their day.</span></p>
<p><span>The requirement consists of seven distribution areas:<strong> Arts and Literature, Biological Science, Historical Studies, International Studies, Philosophy and Values, Physical Science, and Social and Behavioral Sciences.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>For descriptions of these distribution areas, as well as a more information on options to complete breadth, visit the L&amp;S Seven-Course Breadth <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/seven-course-breadth-requirement" target="_blank">website</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span>Guidelines for Seven-Course Breadth</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Complete one approved course for each of the seven areas with a minimum grade of C- or P. To find course options for breadth, go to the <a class="ext" href="http://classes.berkeley.edu/">Class Schedule</a>, select the term of interest, and use the &quot;Breadth Requirements&quot; filter to select the breadth area(s) of interest.  When selecting a course, keep the following in mind:</p>
	</li>
	<li>While some courses may satisfy more than one breadth area, a course may only be used for <em>one</em> of the approved areas. To satisfy the requirement, complete seven distinct courses, one for each breadth area.</li>
	<li>Students may use up to two courses from any one academic department to satisfy the Seven-Course Breadth. This includes all <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/depts_multiple_subjects.pdf">subject areas offered by the department</a> and—if a course is cross-listed (indicated by a 'C' prefix)—all other departments offering the course as well. However,  <a href="/2017-18/courses/l_s/" target="_blank">Letters and Science (&quot;LS&quot;)</a> courses are an exception to this restriction. Students may complete as many <a class="ext" href="/2017-18/courses/l_s/" target="_blank">LS courses</a> as they wish for the Seven-Course Breadth. This includes LS courses offered through the <a class="ext" href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Discovery</a> and <a class="ext" href="http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Big Ideas</a> programs. </li>
	<li>Courses fulfilling <a class="ext" href="/2017-18/undergraduate/colleges-schools/letters-science/american-history-institutions-requirement/" target="_blank">American History &amp; Institutions</a>, <a class="ext" href="http://americancultures.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">American Cultures</a> or requirements in the major program may also be applied to the Seven-Course Breadth requirement.</li>
	<li>Exams, such as Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate exams, cannot be used to fulfill breadth requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Satisfying the Seven Course Breadth Requirement with Transfer Work</h3>
<ul>
	<li>All transfer courses must be completed with a grade of C- or better, or the equivalent of a Passed grade on the host campus, in order to be considered for Seven-Course Breadth. </li>
	<li>To be eligible for consideration, the minimum unit requirement for a course offered from a campus on the semester system is 3.0 units, and for courses offered from campuses on the quarter system, 4.0 units.</li>
	<li>For courses from California Community Colleges, use <a class="ext" href="http://www.assist.org/" target="_blank">ASSIST</a> to identify course options for Seven-Course Breadth. <em>(Note: <a class="ext" href="http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/transfer/general-education-igetc/igetc/index.html" target="_blank">IGETC certification</a>  from a California community college or a letter of reciprocity from a UC campus satisfies the Seven-Course Breadth requirement.) </em></li>
	<li>Successful completion of transferable courses from an accredited college university outside of UC and CCC may also be considered.   Course descriptions and syllabi will be required to make a breadth determination. For more information on pursuing transfer courses for Seven-Course Breadth at another Higher Education institution, review the 'Transfer Credit for Continuing Students' section of <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/planning/transfer-credit">Transfer Credit</a>. </li>
	<li>After the institution where you took the course posts grades, submit an official transcript. If the school where you completed your requirement offers electronic transcripts, request that an e-transcripts be sent to UC Berkeley Business Operations office: <a class="mailto" href="mailto:busops@berkeley.edu">busops@berkeley.edu<span class="element-invisible">(link sends e-mail)</span><span class="mailto"><span class="element-invisible">(link sends e-mail)</span></span></a>.

<h3>Welcome to L&amp;S Office of Undergraduate Advising!</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://ls-advise.berkeley.edu">Office of Undergraduate Advising</a>, with a <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/advising/about-us/ls-office-undergraduate-advising-staff">staff</a> of highly skilled and experienced College Advisers, is here to help students make the best choices for their academic career and get the most out of their time at Berkeley. </p>
<h3><span>Declaring a Major</span></h3>
<p class="m_-5029381020753723279gmail-p1">Students in L&amp;S must declare a major before the first semester of their junior year (for transfer students, before the beginning of the second semester at Berkeley). Those who do not declare by that time will be subject to a registration block, so it is imperative to declare on time. There are other good reasons to declare as soon as students are ready. As a declared student, students will be given higher priority to enroll in courses in their major department, and they will have greater access to departmental advising and other departmental resources.</p>
<p>Students receive approval for admission to the major from <span>the adviser in the department.</span><span> Each department has its own procedures for reviewing </span><span>requests for admission to the major. Some require an application </span><span>an essay, a certain grade point average or a personal </span><span>interview with a Major Adviser. There are <em>competitive</em> majors that demand special </span><span>attention because they have declaration procedures that are </span><span>tied to unit completion. Students must start preparing for </span><span>these majors early in their academic careers. </span><span>For details about declaration </span><span>procedures as well as an overview of units and requirements </span><span>in each major, refer to the Requirements tab of each program page of the Academic Guide.</span></p>

<h3><a href="http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Big Ideas Courses</a></h3>
<p>Big Ideas Courses, launched in 2012, bring together two or more faculty members from different disciplines to co-teach innovative breadth courses. Big Ideas Courses take up key intellectual and societal challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by the perspective or methodology of one discipline alone. For more information, call 510-642-8378 or visit the <a href="http://bigideascourses.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Big Ideas website</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Freshman and Sophomore Seminars</a></h3>
<p>Freshman and Sophomore Seminars arose from the conviction that early intellectual contact with faculty members would greatly enhance the undergraduate experience at Berkeley. Professors from nearly every campus department join together each semester to offer an impressive array of seminars. The courses numbered 24 bear one unit of credit; they are limited to 15 students, and freshmen are given priority for enrollment. The courses numbered 84 bear one or two units of credit; they are limited to 15 sophomores. The courses numbered 39A-39Z are limited to 25 freshmen and sophomores. Seminars, which emphasize interaction and discussion, provide a counterpoint to the learning experience in Berkeley's large lecture halls. These seminars also offer lower-division students an unprecedented opportunity to explore a wide range of majors and even fields of study usually reserved for graduate students. Browsing through this <em>Guide,</em> students will find lower division seminars sponsored by Letters and Science departments as well as by the professional schools and colleges. Descriptions of all the seminars scheduled for the upcoming semester can be found in time for course enrollment on the <a href="http://fss.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Freshman and Sophomore program's website</a> that also contains other useful information and features for undergraduates. For additional information regarding the Freshman and Sophomore Seminars, contact the program office at 231 Evans Hall, 510-642-8378.</p>
