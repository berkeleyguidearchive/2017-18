The ‘designed world’ is implicated in everyday experience. In an increasingly technological and communications based culture-from print to the Web, advertisements to movies, the built environment to modes of pedagogy-we encounter the visual/sensory as a ‘designed world’ in every area of our lives. Art 8 A: Intro to Visual Thinking asks students to rigorously and critically interrogate the ‘designed world.’ To do this students will look at a range of art</span><span class="deschide">, media, and invention across many locations and periods of history.</span><br />

This course will challenge students to use ceramics as a way to explore and understand three-dimensional space, and use a contemporary art framework for critiquing and discussing the work produced. We will develop a practical understanding of how clay and glaze behave, while building a conceptual framework through which to apply this knowledge. Studio practice includes hand building, modeling, carving, and glazing as possibilities for turning</span><span class="deschide"> ideas into three dimensional propositions. Illustrated talks will help acquaint students with the ideas artists have explored through history and in contemporary sculptural practices.</span><br />

This is a basic foundation class for digital photography with hands-on instruction in the use of digital cameras and online image dissemination. Topics include image capture, composition, image syntax, image analysis, image manipulation, meta-text production, and image sequencing for visual narratives. We also study image dissemination through online networks-social networks, blogs, news, storage</span><span class="deschide">, search, and print services. Rather than limiting the discussion of photography to the production of the photographic image itself, we explore in written assignments how the reception of images can change based on context, usage, and network dynamics. We use required DSLR digital cameras to produce images for weekly photographic assignments.</span><br />

This new course will enable students to think critically about, and engage in practical experiments in, the complex interactions between new media and perceptions and performances of embodiment, agency, citizenship, collective action, individual identity, time and spatiality. We will pay particular attention to the categories of personhood that make up the UC Berkeley American Cultures rubric (race and ethnicity), as well as to gender, nation,</span><span class="deschide"> and disability. The argument threading through the course will be the ways in which new media both reinforce pre-existing social hierarchies, and yet offer possibilities for the transcendence of those very categories. The new media -- and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester -- can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.</span><br />

This course will examine how visual artists have responded to illness and disability. We will consider visual representations of disability and healing, as well as the expressive work of visual artists working from within the personal experience of disability; in other words, we will look at disability as both a subject and a source of artistic creation. Several topics, historical and contemporary, will be explored. Students will complete</span><span class="deschide"> either a semester-long internship with an arts and disability organization, a research paper, or a creative project.</span><br />

Motion is a ubiquitous element of human experience, yet attempts to explain it remain incomplete. The representation of motion with technical means is in continuous development, starting perhaps with sculptural representations of celestial movements in antiquity and leading to dynamic computer graphics simulations of molecular processes today. In this production-intensive studio course, we will study</span><span class="deschide"> computer graphics for motion simulations, or animations. We will also probe these tools for their use in creative expression and analyze their impact on our own perception of motion. Software used: Maya.

Game studies has five core elements: the study of games as transmitters of culture, the study of play and interactivity, the study of games as symbolic systems; the study of games as artifacts; and methods for creating games. We will study these core elements through play, play tests, play analysis, and comparative studies. Our reading list includes classic game studies theory</span><span class="deschide"> and texts which support game design methods.
