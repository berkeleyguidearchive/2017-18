How do mechanisms of perception structure responses to visual art? What is at stake when words describe images?

An introduction to the art of Egypt, Greece, Rome, and the European Middle Ages. Works of painting, sculpture, and architecture are presented chronologically and interpreted within their particular historical circumstances. The course focuses on themes such as the social and ideological functions of art, strategies of realism and abstraction, rhetorics of the material and immaterial, patronage and the construction of viewing</span><span class="deschide">, etc. It enables students to acquire the perceptual and critical skills to enjoy, interpret, and question works of art.

An introduction to the art of ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and the European Middle Ages. Painting, sculpture, and architecture are presented chronologically and considered in relation to their historical and cultural circumstances. The course aims to provide students with a basic knowledge of how artworks balance past tradition with innovation; how people actually looked at artworks and what they valued in them; how works of art were commissioned and</span><span class="deschide"> displayed; how artists went about their work; and how genre and medium affected an artwork's appearance. The question of artistic quality will be central to the course. In the process, the student will acquire a critical vocabulary for thinking and writing about art. Recommended both for potential majors and for students with a general interest in the topic.</span><br />

An introduction to the historical circumstances and visual character of Western art from the Renaissance to the present. Not a chronological survey, but an exploration of topics and themes central to this period. For example: What tasks did painting and sculpture perform in the past? For whom, at whose expense? How do the rise of landscape painting, the cult of the artist, and the new emphasis on the nude relate to the emergence of modern</span><span class="deschide"> society? Do stylistic labels like Classicism, Realism, Impressionism, and Modernism help us answer such questions?

This course is an introduction to the visual arts of Europe and the USA from the 14th century to the present day. This course will attempt to situate works of art into long, general trends in art practice of the Western tradition, though it will prioritize sustained focus on single case-studies which punctuate the five centuries of art for which this course offers a historical account; attention will also gather around particular representative</span><span class="deschide"> artists’ careers. We’ll explore how the fine arts can be considered as part of wider visual culture(s) in the Western tradition, and the ways art within such a broad tradition can function both as a stabilizing and as a transformative force within social/political/religious/racial/etc contexts.</span><br />

Rather than follow a master chronology that would attempt to contain Africa’s multiple cultural formations in a single narrative, this course will introduce students to African art through an investigation of a range of aesthetic traditions and movements across sub-Saharan Africa that are meaningfully reinvigorated in contemporary artistic production and popular visual culture. Our continual return to the cultural politics of the present will provide an anchor and</span><span class="deschide"> roadmap for our inquiry; we will see contemporary visual culture as staging interventions that push at Western ideas of “primitive African tradition,” while bringing to the fore conventions that, when tracked, reveal alternative traditions legible within an art historical context.</span><br />

An introduction to the arts and visual culture of Latin America from the earliest monumental art traditions of prehistory to the present. The course is not a comprehensive survey of all traditions of art in Latin America, but rather a sampling of critical moments that is designed to serve as an introduction to this field of study. We will take a long view of enduring traditions as well as periods of rupture and crisis. Lecture and discussion will frequently</span><span class="deschide"> center on the active roles of the arts in society, religion, and politics from the earliest Pre-Columbian settings to the present day. No prior knowledge of Latin American art history is expected. This course is designed for both majors and non-majors in the humanities and sciences.</span><br />

Important individuals in Greek and Roman society were commemorated both in honorific portraits—bronze and marble statues set up in public places—and in biographies written to record for posterity their lives and achievements. We will be reading a selection of Greek and Latin biographical texts (in translation) and comparing them with statuary monuments that represent the same individuals. We will be seeking to elicit the points of contact between the two commemorative</span><span class="deschide"> traditions, visual and literary, and to understand the sometimes similar functions they serve. But we will also be attempting to bring out the differences in the way that biographical texts and portrait images operate, and the consequences this has for historians.</span><br />

This course will take a close look at some of the art produced in Europe and America in the decades following the Second World War. In addition to painting, sculpture, and photography, we will also examine video, performance, and intermedia art. Of particular interest will be defining the balance of concerns demonstrated by artists during this time between form and content, abstraction</span><span class="deschide"> and representation, and the intersection of their artworks with culture at large--including issues of technology, the body, commercial economy, and public space. Along with a wide range of images, our discussions will consider theoretical and critical texts.</span><br />

This seminar will look at specific case studies of the production and use of architecture, paintings, and quilting within specific communities in what is now the United States. We will look, for instance, at Shaker watercolors and design; Puritan painting and city planning; Amish, Hawaiian, and Hmong quilting; the ledger drawings and domestic structures of specific Native American groups; and the sacred architecture of the Hispanic southwest. Our timeframe</span><span class="deschide"> spans four centuries but our &quot;geographies&quot; will be very focused.

This seminar looks at both material culture theory and the practice of interpreting objects in the West and in Asia. It draws on the practices and inquiries of multiple disciplines including archaeology, anthropology, cultural geography, and art history . We will consider the variety of ways and contexts in which objects have been understood to &quot;speak&quot; as aesthetic vehicles and as cultural texts. Taught by two faculty members who</span><span class="deschide"> have extensive experience as museum curators--one of American Art, the other of Asian Art, this class will combine theory with hands-on learning.</span><br />

Mimesis, Greek for &quot;imitation&quot; is a key term in recent debates in a number of disciplines. However, what is at its core is often astonishingly undefined, open and ambivalent. Starting with antique and medieval works addressing key moments of mimesis we will also explore modern theories of mimesis. Crossing the threshold between pre-modern and modern examples will help us to understand the premises for the visual culture involving the rise of naturalism,</span><span class="deschide"> and more generally the nature of representation in medieval and early modern culture.</span><br />
