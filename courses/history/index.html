History 1 introduces students to core dynamics of global history. Traversing the experience of human societies from earliest origins to the complex, chaotic, and cacophonous twenty-first century, the course highlights recurrent themes including the origins and development of political order; the evolution of interstate (or international) relations; and the historical advance of globalization. From this vast panorama, students will acquire a broad, even foundational</span><span class="deschide">, perspective on the human past and new insight into transcendent problems in the human experience.</span><br />

Intended for non-majors as well as prospective majors, this course introduces students to the discipline of history as a humanistic inquiry into the experiences of people in time and space.

This course is an introduction to the history of the United States from the beginning of the European colonization of North America to the end of the Civil War. It is also an introduction to the ways historians look at the past and think about evidence. There are two main themes: one is to understand the origin of the &quot;groups&quot; we call European-Americans, Native-Americans, and African-Americans; the second, is to understand how democratic</span><span class="deschide"> political institutions emerged in the United States in this period in the context of an economy that depended on slave labor and violent land acquisition.</span><br />

What does it mean to be American? Whatever your answer is to this question, chances are it is deeply connected to the themes and events we will discuss in this class.

In this connector course, we will explore how historical data becomes historical evidence and how recent technological advances affect long-established practices, such as close attention to historical context and contingency. Will the advent of fast computing and big data make history “count” more or lead to unprecedented insights into the study of change over time? During our weekly discussions, we will apply what we learn in lectures and</span><span class="deschide"> labs to the analysis of selected historical sources and get an understanding of constructing historical datasets. We will also consider scholarly debates over quantitative evidence and historical argument.</span><br />

Here we will deal with the history of South Asia between the coming of the Europeans and the present. It will be organized around a series of contested formulations about the recent South Asian past. One of these problems is: how was India comprehended and manipulated by the Europeans? The second problem is: How was India conquered, by the sword or by the word? The third is: How did Indians resist the British? Finally, how was the voice of</span><span class="deschide"> women, lower classes, and others expressed and heard? We will read books about language, gender, the &quot;subaltern&quot; classes, and women in an attempt to understand these questions.</span><br />

For most of human history, urban living has been the experience of a distinct minority. Only in the past two hundred years have the physicial spaces, social relations, and lifestyles associated with large cities entered the mainstream. This course examines the long century of urban growth between 1825 and 1933, when big cities came into being in the United States. Focusing on large metropolitian centers (especially on New York, Chicago, and</span><span class="deschide"> San Francisco), we will study the way urban spaces provided sites and sources of new modes of personal interaction, popular entertainment, social conflict, and political expression.</span><br />

World War II lifted the U.S. from the Great Depression and launched a long economic boom that helped underwrite and propel efforts on behalf of greater racial equality and economic equity. As that boom began to fade in the late 1960s, America’s march toward greater racial equality foundered, while its march toward greater economic equity began to reverse course. The Civil Rights Era gave way to the New Gilded Age. This course will explore the political, legal, and</span><span class="deschide"> economic history of America’s struggles for racial equality and economic equity – and the relationship between them.</span><br />

This course surveys Cuban history, culture, and politics from the 15th century to the present. We will examine both the outsized role the island has played in world history and the dramatic ways world history has refracted through the island’s turbulent past. How has Cuban history and culture been shaped by its unique position in global geopolitics, at the crossroads of Europe, the Americas, and Africa? How have inhabitants of Cuba struggled against ongoing relationships</span><span class="deschide"> of colonialism and dependency with foreign powers? How have inhabitants of Cuba defined what it means to be Cuban both because of and in spite of these global forces? We will draw on a wide array of texts from long before the famous Revolution of 1959 to well after.</span><br />

The eighteenth century in Europe witnessed a series of &quot;revolutions&quot;--intellectual, political, and to a lesser extent, social and economic--that together constitute the birth rites of modern European society and culture. Historians collectively agree that the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the European expansion of Napoleonic France were events of world-historical significance, yet the causes and precise meaning of these</span><span class="deschide"> events are the subjects of substantial disagreement. We will study the transformations of the eighteenth century that announced our modern world, and we will also try to make sense of the different ways that historians disagree about the meaning of what happened.</span><br />

Fascism is a crucial subject to understanding the modern world. It was a break with all forms of political organization known to that point, and travelled speedily across national boundaries, to find representation in every European state west of the Soviet Union. Yet it prospered very differently by place -- strong in Romania, weak in Poland -- and came to power only in Germany and Italy, and from there transformed our world, with destructive energies that were unprecedented</span><span class="deschide">, revealing the ultimate consequences of an ideology based in racial supremacy.<br/>
The course surveys all aspects of this movement, from intellectual origins in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, through the extreme experience of World War II.<br/></span><br />

Europe has experienced three revolutions in the past two centuries. The first was political, the second was economic, and the third was what Raymond Williams called the &quot;cultural revolution&quot; - the dramatic shift from a largely oral and iconographic world to one of universal literacy and the technology of modern communications. By means of readings, lectures, discussions, films and slides, the class will examine the meaning of the</span><span class="deschide"> revolutionary change for the lives of ordinary men and women, as well as the responses of selected writers, artists, and social theorists to the culture of democratization.</span><br />

This course explores modern France and its place in the world. We begin with the French Revolution, one of the truly earth-shaking events in history, and then we follow French history through a series of monarchical, authoritarian, and democratic regimes. In the process, we will also trace the emergence, expansion and decline of a great colonial empire. Issues of focus include French cultural and intellectual life; empire as a way of life not</span><span class="deschide"> only for colonists but also for those living in mainland France; religion; immigration; battles over “who is French”; and dramatic changes in French economy and society during the past two centuries.</span><br />

Early Modern German history contains many lessons concerning the relationship of war and peace, of violence and toleration, of reform and renewal and the rejection of any change, of Baroque splendor and widespread misery, of some progress and much disappointment</span><span class="deschide">, in short: of a most complicated legacy for future generations.</span><br />

This course provides the essential foundation for understanding the catastrophic history of Germany in the 20th Century, as well as some of its successes. A central theme is the struggle to define and impose a single national identity on socially, culturally, and religiously diverse peoples in an age of Great Power conflict. Although the region now known as Germany will be the focus of our investigation, considerable attention will also be paid</span><span class="deschide"> to the Hapsburg Empire, for until 1866 Austria was officially a part of &quot;Germany&quot; and remained, for nearly a century thereafter, culturally and in popular consciousness a part of a &quot;Greater Germany.&quot;</span><br />

This course will focus on the history of Italy during a period when it was the leading center of European artistic and cultural production and the driving force in the revival of classical learning and literary ideals. This was the Italy of Raphael and Michelangelo, Ariosto and Alberti, Brunelleschi and Botticelli. At the same time, Italy was also a political battleground through most of this period, both in the realm of ideas and theory but</span><span class="deschide"> also in a literal sense. It was in Italy that &quot;the art of war,&quot; as Machiavelli called it, took center stage as the peninsula became one of the major theaters of war between the great powers of the age, France and Spain. The course will combine a study of the artistic, intellectual, religious, and political history of Italy in this period both as it developed internally and as it was related to the rest of Europe and the Mediterranean world. Requirements will include a midterm, a final, and an optional final paper.</span><br />

In 1721, Peter the Great chose the title of Emperor for himself, and declared that Russia would be an Empire. The empire lasted until the revolutions of 1917, but was never entirely stable. The Romanovs believed that autocracy was the key to good governance. Yet, the reigns of almost all the Romanov Emperors were marked by coups d'etat, peasant rebellions, and, later, assassination attempts. Russia's expanding boundaries and growing population</span><span class="deschide"> made it even more difficult to rule. This course will focus heavily on political history and political thought. Given the many factors that were tearing Peter's Empire apart, it will ask, what held it together for so many years?</span><br />

This course introduces students to Russian intellectual history from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, covering aspects of political, social, and religious thought.We will observe Russian thinkers elaborate conceptions of nationalism in a multi-ethnic empire, trying to resolve the eternal question of Russia's national identity: whether it belongs to the East or West? Next, we will move on to social</span><span class="deschide"> thought, including debates on serfdom, populism, the &quot;women question,&quot; the nature of progress, and the rise of Marxism. Finally, we will study debates on religion: the pertinence of Orthodox Christian faith in social and philosophical thought, including early twentieth century religious rebuttals to Marx</span><br />

This course examines the establishment of the ideas and institutions of modern physics over the last century and a half.We begin with the 19th century organization of the discipline and the debates over the classical world picture (mechanics, electromagnetism and optics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics).We follow the dramatic changes that undid the classical picture, from the discovery of radioactivity through Einstein's theories of</span><span class="deschide"> relativity on to the creation of quantum mechanics and the accompanying philosophical disputes.Alongside these conceptual upheavals we will look at the evolving structure of the discipline, its links with industry and government, and the massive transformations of WWII, culminating in the atomic bomb.</span><br />

The course deals with the origins of Christianity and the first eleven centuries of its expansion into a major institutional, social, and intellectual force shaping Western Europe. The central themes are the mechanisms and conditions shaping this expansion, rather than a chronological account in order to present this process as a model of institutionalization of religious movements. The emphasis will be on patterns of crisis and reform; i.e.</span><span class="deschide">, on conflicts arising within the church itself and as a result of its dealings with the &quot;outside&quot; world, and how these crises were resolved. The course is based on the study of primary sources and will include problems of historical method.</span><br />

This course follows 185A as the 2nd of two semesters on the History of Christianity. It treats the history of (principally Western) Christianity between the High Middle Ages and the present in Europe and in the rest of the world.

This class will introduce graduate students to a variety of techniques and theories used in teaching history at the university level. It will examine readings dealing with a range of classroom situations, opportunities, and challenges, with the goal of enabling future college teachers of history to understand the learning process of their students and to develop and improve their own teaching skills. The course will have two primary goals: (1)</span><span class="deschide"> to train graduate students to work more effectively as graduate student instructors in history classes at Berkeley; and (2) to introduce students to techniques of designing and running their own classes that they will use when they become independent instructors and, ultimately, professors of history in their own right.</span><br />
