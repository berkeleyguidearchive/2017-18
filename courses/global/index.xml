This course offers an introduction to ways of thinking about, and visualizing, “the global” over time. People from different societies and cultures have been drawn together as a result of processes that can best be conceived of as “flows” of people, capital, ideas and goods. Using a panoramic lens, we will explore a series of interactions, analyzing the wide-ranging effects of those interactions and the artifacts they</span><span class="deschide"> produced. By studying a variety of encounters, we will cultivate a broader sense of how the “global” has been defined and experienced through the lens of cultural interaction. Globalization itself is not a new phenomenon; it can be traced back centuries if not millennia.</span><br/>

This course will describe the issues, policies and practices of counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency. Terrorism continues to increase in frequency and lethality. Insurgency too is more frequent and deadly (insurgency now is riskier than terrorism). The actors and methods increasingly overlap, so that terrorism and insurgency practically must be studied together. This course examines the concepts, history, motivations and methods of terrorism and insurgency, and</span><span class="deschide"> ways in which the counter-terrorist and counter-insurgent side counter those motivations and methods, navigating the legal and ethical bounds.</span><br/>
