The course is concerned with giving students the tools to prepare for the fields and jobs of the future.<br/>
<br/>
Across all university departments and majors, the numbers of students who do not work in the fields in which they’ve received their degrees is not only significant, but growing. For example, anywhere from 20-40% of STEM graduates do not work in the fields in which they received their degrees.<br/>
<br/>
This does not mean that students shouldn’t major</span><span class="deschide"> in STEM, but that one of the primary purposes of higher education is learning how to learn. Accordingly, this course presents a number of frameworks that are critical for thinking about that which has not yet been invented.<br/></span><br />

This course offers an integrated treatment of three topics essential to modern engineering: linear algebra, random processes, and optimization. These topics will be covered more rapidly than in separate undergraduate courses covering the same material, and will draw on engineering examples for motivation. The stress will be on proofs and computational aspects will also be highlighted. It is intended for engineering students whose research focus</span><span class="deschide"> has a significant mathematical component, but who have not previously had a thorough exposure to these topics.</span><br />

This course is designed to give students a broad overview of the main topics encompassed by management of technology. It includes the full chain of innovative activities beginning with research and development and extending through production and marketing. Why do many existing firms fail to incorporate new technology in a timely manner? At each stage of innovation, we examine key factors determining successful management of technology. What</span><span class="deschide"> constitutes a successful technology strategy? The integrating course focus will be on the emergence of the knowledge economy and technology as a key knowledge asset and will involve both general readings and cases. The course also introduces students to Haas and COE faculty working in the relevant areas.</span><br />

This course is designed to examine the strategic issues that confront the management of the development stage biotech company, i.e., after its start-up via an initial capital infusion, but before it might be deemed successful (e.g., by virtue of a product launch), or otherwise has achieved &quot;first-tier&quot; status. Thus, the intention is to study the biotech organization during the process of it growth and maturation from an early stage existence</span><span class="deschide"> through &quot;adolescence&quot; into an &quot;adult&quot; company. The focus of the class will be on business development, i.e., the deal making that must occur to accomplish the corporate objectives of bringing in new technologies and getting the initial products to market. We will explore the critical deal issues from both the perspective of the development stage company and the viewpoint of the larger, more mature biotech or big pharma company with which it seeks to partner.</span><br />

This course seeks to make sense of, inter alia, the decline and prospective recovery of U.S. high-technology industries, the evolution of innovation and technology strategies and policies in Western Europe and Asia, the historic and current roles of governments in shaping markets for high-technology goods, and the impact on business strategies of recent developments in early-stage capital markets. Our general approach views technological innovation and competition</span><span class="deschide"> as dynamic processes that reflect previous choices made by firms and governments. Modern technologies develop in markets that are international scope, often imperfectly competitive, and subject to influence by a variety of economic and political stakeholders. We will use an eclectic mix of theoretical, historical, and practical perspectives throughout the course in examining these issues, although no special familarity with any of these is assumed. From time to time, we will be joined by venture capitalists, corporate executives, and technologists engaged in global high-technology markets for discussion of these issues.</span><br />
