<h2>Archived Breadth from the Guide</h2>




<p>This is the archived list of Breadth Courses, last updated by Jenne in late August/early September 2015. On September 25, after a meeting with Bob, Roseanne, Johanna, Jenne, Anne Aaboe, Alix, and Shalin, it was decided that the Guide would remove its Breadth pages and that the L&amp;S pages would be reinstated. The long-term goal (within 6-9 months) is to incorporate breadth attributes in the new Campus Solutions/Student Information System and through an API, the Guide would grab the data and repost the information on the Guide breadth pages.</p>

<h3><a id="Arts" name="Arts">Arts and Literature</a><br/>
This page was updated on Friday, August 28, 2015.</h3>




<p><strong>Beginning fall 2015, breadth courses must be at least three units in value.</strong></p>




<p>The following courses satisfy the Arts and Literature area of the Seven Course Breadth requirement. No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the Seven Course Breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt). Courses numbered 84, 97, 98, 99, and 190 and above do not receive breadth credit. In cases where any of the courses listed below are offered online (indicated by a &quot;W&quot; prefix), that course will be treated in the same way as its regular semester counterpart and will satisfy this breadth area.</p>




<p>Students who have successfully completed  2 unit breadth prior to fall 2015 will be accepted for graduation requirements.</p>

<h3><a id="Biol" name="Biol">Biological Science</a><br/>
This page was updated on Monday, August 31, 2015.</h3>




<p><strong>Beginning fall 2015, breadth courses must be at least three units in value.</strong></p>




<p>The following courses satisfy the Biological Science area of the Seven Course Breadth requirement. No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the Seven Course Breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt). Courses numbered 84, 97, 98, 99, and 190 and above do not receive breadth credit. In cases where any of the courses listed below are offered online (indicated by a &quot;W&quot; prefix), that course will be treated in the same way as its regular semester counterpart and will satisfy this breadth area.</p>




<p>Students who have successfully completed  2 unit breadth prior to fall 2015 will be accepted for graduation requirements.</p>

<h3><a id="Hist" name="Hist">Historical Studies</a><br/>
This page was updated on Monday, August 31, 2015.</h3>




<p><strong>Beginning fall 2015, breadth courses must be at least three units in value.</strong></p>




<p>The following courses satisfy the Historical Studies area of the Seven Course Breadth requirement.  No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the Seven Course Breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt). Courses numbered 84, 97, 98, 99, and 190 and above do not receive breadth credit. In cases where any of the courses listed below are offered online (indicated by a &quot;W&quot; prefix), that course will be treated in the same way as its regular semester counterpart and will satisfy this breadth area.</p>




<p>Students who have successfully completed  2 unit breadth prior to fall 2015 will be accepted for graduation requirements.</p>

<h3><a id="Inte" name="Inte">International Studies</a><br/>
This page was updated on Tuesday, September 1, 2015.</h3>




<p><strong>Beginning fall 2015, breadth courses must be at least three units in value.</strong></p>




<p>The following courses satisfy the International Studies area of the Seven Course Breadth requirement. No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the Seven Course Breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt). Courses numbered 84, 97, 98, 99, and 190 and above do not receive breadth credit. In cases where any of the courses listed below are offered online (indicated by a &quot;W&quot; prefix), that course will be treated in the same way as its regular semester counterpart and will satisfy this breadth area.</p>




<p>Third semester or higher level foreign language courses satisfy the International Studies requirement, as listed below. Heritage language courses are excluded from International Studies credit. Second level language courses may be used only in rare cases where the courses are not used to satisfy the Foreign Language requirement.</p>




<p>The International Studies requirement may also be satisfied by participation in the UC Education Abroad Program or an equivalent program.</p>




<p>Students who have successfully completed  2 unit breadth prior to fall 2015 will be accepted for graduation requirements.</p>

<h3><a id="Phil" name="Phil">Philosophy and Values</a><br/>
This page was updated on Friday, August 28, 2015.</h3>




<p><strong>Beginning fall 2015, breadth courses must be at least three units in value.</strong></p>




<p>The following courses satisfy the Philosophy and Values area of the Seven Course Breadth requirement. No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the Seven Course Breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt). Courses numbered 84, 97, 98, 99, and 190 and above do not receive breadth credit. In cases where any of the courses listed below are offered online (indicated by a &quot;W&quot; prefix), that course will be treated in the same way as its regular semester counterpart and will satisfy this breadth area.</p>




<p>Students who have successfully completed  2 unit breadth prior to fall 2015 will be accepted for graduation requirements.</p>

This page was updated on Monday, August 31, 2015.</h3>




<p><strong>Beginning fall 2015, breadth courses must be at least three units in value.</strong></p>




<p>The following courses satisfy the Physical Science area of the Seven Course Breadth requirement. No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the Seven Course Breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt). Courses numbered 84, 97, 98, 99, and 190 and above do not receive breadth credit. In cases where any of the courses listed below are offered online (indicated by a &quot;W&quot; prefix), that course will be treated in the same way as its regular semester counterpart and will satisfy this breadth area.</p>




<p>Students who have successfully completed  2 unit breadth prior to fall 2015 will be accepted for graduation requirements.</p>

<h3><a id="Soci" name="Soci">Social and Behavioral Sciences</a><br/>
This page was updated on Tuesday, September 1, 2015</h3>




<p><strong>Beginning fall 2015, breadth courses must be at least three units in value.</strong></p>




<p>The following courses satisfy the Social and Behavioral Sciences area of the Seven Course Breadth requirement.  No more than two courses from any one department may be used to satisfy the Seven Course Breadth requirement (<a href="http://lsdiscovery.berkeley.edu/">L&amp;S Discovery courses</a> are exempt). Courses numbered 84, 97, 98, 99, and 190 and above do not receive breadth credit. In cases where any of the courses listed below are offered online (indicated by a &quot;W&quot; prefix), that course will be treated in the same way as its regular semester counterpart and will satisfy this breadth area.</p>




<p>Students who have successfully completed  2 unit breadth prior to fall 2015 will be accepted for graduation requirements.</p>
